PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p><i><span class="smcap gesperrt">No</span> books are generally more entertaining and instructive, than
the accounts of travels into foreign countries; and especially
those, which are written in the way of</i> Journals. <i>For he,
who reads such narratives, is almost apt to fancy himself in company
with the traveler, and to take part with him in all his adventures;
which at the same time that they shew the peculiar temper, customs,
and manners of different nations, excite also a variety of passions,
which by their succession please the mind, and make the chief delight
even in theatrical performances.</i></p>

<p><i><span class="smcap gesperrt">Upon</span> this account it is, that the</i> Letters <i>of</i> Busbequius, <i>during
his embassy in</i> Turkey; <i>and the</i> Journies <i>of our ingenious and
learned countryman Mr.</i> Maundrell, <i>thro several parts of the
same vast empire, which he has so accurately described; are repeatedly
read, and always with new pleasure</i>.</p>

<p><i><span class="smcap gesperrt">Therefore</span>, when Mr.</i> Edmund Chishull, <i>only Son of the late
Reverend</i> Mr. Chishull, <i>who was for some years chaplain to the</i> Factory
<i>of our Worshipful</i> Turkey Company <i>at</i> Smyrna, <i>brought to
me not many months since the present</i> Journal <i>of his Father’s</i>
Travels, <i>desiring me to peruse it, and give him my opinion, whether
it was a work worthy to be published; I could not refuse his request
but applied myself with due care to read and examine it. And I was
the more readily induced to this, as I had thro a course of many
years the happiness of a perfect acquaintance with his father, even
from his return home to his death; and knew him, as well from his
conversation, as his writings (particularly that justly celebrated book<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
of his</i> Antiquitates Asiaticae) <i>to be not only a man of uncommon
learning, but likewise of great sagacity, and indefatigable diligence</i>.</p>

<p><i><span class="smcap gesperrt">And</span> indeed my pains in the perusal of these papers were very
well rewarded. For besides an agreable amusement common to
other writings of this nature, they gave me very useful instruction
as to several passages in ancient historians, and other classic authors;
and at the same time illustrated many old inscriptions, several of
which are now first published, and others taken with greater exactness,
than had been done formerly.</i></p>

<p><i><span class="smcap gesperrt">Hence</span> I could not but persuade the young Gentleman to oblige
the world with this work, and to have it printed in such a manner,
as his freinds should advise him. Tho I easily foresaw, that the doing
of this would necessarily be attended with some difficulties; as
Mr.</i> Chishull <i>had put into writing those occurrences, which he thought
worthy of his notice, at such leisure minutes, as he could snatch from
the constant fatigues of his journey; and by that means had sometimes
not only thrown many things together without exact order, but
often left the places cited from ancient writers to be supplied out of their
own works. And besides, his hand being both small and hasty, was frequently
not very easy to be read; so that many of the words, as to
the manner of spelling, appeared doubtful and uncertain. This made
it needful to have the whole first fairly transcribed, and then to fill
up the quotations. The former task therefore I committed to a professed
penman, and the latter I undertook myself. In the doing of
which I not only carefully compared the transcriber’s copy with the
original; but had recourse to the authors themselves, and took out
of them the several passages, to which the references were made.</i></p>

<p><i><span class="smcap gesperrt">When</span> Mr.</i> Chishull <i>left</i> England, <i>he was fellow of</i> Corpus
Christi <i>college in</i> Oxford, <i>and had a grant of the traveler’s place
from the president and society. He set sail from the</i> Downs <i>September
the 12, 1698, in the</i> Neptune <i>frigate, Capt.</i> Thomas <i>commander,
and arrived at</i> Smyrna <i>November the 19 following. During
the voyage, agreably to his usual diligence, he constantly kept a</i> Journal
<i>of what then offered. But as nothing very remarkable occurred
at sea; for that reason the account of his</i> Travels, <i>which is here published,
begins with a</i> Journey <i>undertaken by him some months after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span>
his settlement at</i> Smyrna. <i>However as in his passage he went on
shoar first at</i> Cadiz, <i>then at</i> Messina, <i>and after that in the island
of</i> Milo; <i>in each of which places he made several observations,
which he afterwards sent in a</i> Letter <i>from</i> Smyrna <i>to Dr.</i> Thomas
Turner, <i>president of his college: that</i> Letter is <i>likewise now published
at the end of this book</i>.</p>

<p><i><span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> as he has generally remarked the situation, government, and
other curiosities, of the most considerable cities, thro which he passed;
it may seem strange, that no account is here given of</i> Smyrna, <i>the
place of his residence, and where, as he himself tells us, he continued
from November 19, 1698, to February 10, 1701-2. This however
was occasioned by his design of treating upon that place in
a more distinct and particular manner; for which purpose there is
a large number of minutes, or heads, detached in a separate part
of the book, relating both to the antient and present state of the city;
which were afterwards to have been filled up, and inlarged. Tho
as they are now left, nothing more appears, that can be of any service
to the public, than what here follows.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> antiquities now extant in this place are these. The <i>castle</i>,
which was <i>Roman</i>, and where <i>Dolabella</i> beheaded <i>Trebonius</i>. The
large head of <i>Smyrna</i> the <i>Amazon</i> over the gate of the same. The
inscription relating to <i>Joannes Ducas</i> over another gate of the
same, with the modern oriental <i>eagle</i> on both sides. The small
remains of the <i>theatre</i>, in which <i>S. Polycarp</i> was burnt, lately taken
to pieces to build the <i>Vizír kane</i> of the place, and <i>bezesten</i>, or
<i>market</i>. The reliques of <i>St. John’s church</i>. The space and walls
of an ancient <i>cirque</i>. All which are on the said castle hill, which
immediately overlooks the city. The ruins of the <i>temple of Apollo</i>
at the foot of mount <i>Corycus</i>, in an olive grove, and over the
θερμὰ ὕδατα. The ruins of the <i>temple of Aesculapius</i>, or <i>Neptune</i>,
in the way to <i>Eshekléer</i>; where was lately found the head of
<i>Janus</i>, and another of <i>M. Modius</i>. A rich and delicate pavement
of <i>mosaic</i> work by the sea side, towards the north, at a place
where the outer wall terminates in the shore; which possibly is
the remains of the <i>gymnasium</i>, or some heathen temple. The several
<i>inscriptions</i> there lately found, reported in <i>Prideaux</i>, or at
the end of this book. The large <i>stones</i> of a yard and half square
in a great and massy wall, now part of a <i>kane</i> in the <i>Armenian</i>
street, on all of which is marked the letter V, as large as the breadth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
of the stone would permit. The remains of an old <i>Roman</i> way,
paved with broad and massy stones, but smooth, in the road over
the castle hill toward <i>Ephesus</i>. The remains of the ancient wall
encompassing the <i>pomoerium</i>, or a large space of ground about
two thousand paces distant all round from the castle, or the city.
The scarcity of antiquities now to be found in <i>Smyrna</i> arises from
hence, that it furnished the greatest part of the <i>Marmora Arundeliana</i>.</p>

<p><i><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> inscriptions here said to be</i> reported in Prideaux, <i>are to
be found in the Doctor’s edition of the</i> Marmora Arundeliana. <i>And
as to those referred to</i> at the end of our author’s book, <i>such of them
will be here subjoined, as are not in the large collection designed by him
for a</i> second part <i>of his</i> Antiquitates Asiaticae; <i>of which a few sheets
only, containing those which relate to</i> Ephesus, <i>were printed by him
a little before his death, and the rest are now in my possession</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> a very pleasant valley near the bank of the river <i>Meles</i>, scarce
thirty paces without the city.</p>

<p><i><span class="smcap gesperrt">What</span> he has said in relation to the present</i> Smyrna, <i>is as
follows</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Smyrna</span> is situated in the latitude of 38<i>gr.</i> 40<i>m.</i> in a deep bay,
that enters within the continent about ten leagues; and is so well
defended by the <i>Erythraean</i> promontory, now cape <i>Kara Bornu</i>, and
mount <i>Corycus</i>, with the hills commonly called <i>Cordilieu</i>, and
its own windings, that it is every where a port, affording good
depths and secure anchorage. Immediately within the bay are
seven islands, lying in length towards the port of <i>Vourlá</i>, antiently
<i>Clazomenae</i>, which of old were called the <i>Peristerides</i>; and the
biggest of them, <i>Megale</i>, is now by the English named <i>Long Island</i>,
over against <i>Fochia Vecchia</i>, or <i>Phocaea</i>. Cape <i>Kara Bornu</i>, or
<i>Black Nose</i> (antiently the ἄκρα μέλαινα) afforded, as <i>Strabo</i> says, excellent
mill stones; which is not unknown to the present inhabitants,
and therefore we there see several mills now employed. Within
two leagues and a half of the city the <i>Hermus</i> enters the bay, and
there forms a bed of sand; which being met by a point of land
from the opposite shore stops up the haven by a very narrow
chanel, thus rendring it κλειστὸς, as <i>Strabo</i> then expressed it. On
the said point stands a new and strong fort, called <i>Sangiac Castle</i>;
because the <i>Grand Signior’s</i> colours are there exposed, on occasions
that require it. From hence we sail towards <i>Smyrna</i>, in a fair
and long arm of the sea, which imitates the pleasures of a canal;
whilst the woody mountains on each side, with the city at one
end, and the castle at the other, conspire to give a mutual beauty
to one another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span></p>

<p><i><span class="smcap gesperrt">Had</span> our author lived to finish his elaborate account of</i> Smyrna,
<i>from the large materials he had collected for that design, it would
doubtless have been a very useful work, and thrown much light upon
many passages in ancient writers. And indeed every part of his</i>
Travels <i>must certainly have received great advantage and improvements
from his review. Tho I question not, but in their present state
they will meet with such a reception from the public, as will reward
the labours of the learned Father, by a proper incouragement given
to his industrious Son.</i></p>

<p><i><span class="smcap gesperrt">I shall</span> only add, that some intimation having been given of a</i>
Map, <i>designed to be published with this book that was judged afterwards
not so necessary, as at first was apprehended; since there are
so many maps already extant of those countries, which make the subject
of these</i> Travels. <i>And therefore as the principal use of such a
map would have been to exhibit both the ancient and modern names
of several places, which are mentioned by our author; an</i> Index
<i>was thought more commodious for that purpose. Besides, as he has
occasionally introduced many Turkish and other foreign words, without
explaining them; this affords likewise an opportunity for their explication.
As the benefit of the reader has been consulted in this alteration;
so it is not to be doubted, but he will find the advantage of it
in perusing the work.</i></p>

<i>Sardis</i>, <i>Birghée</i>, <i>Tyria</i>, <i>Ephesus</i>, and back to

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xxi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Eight</span> of our nation having lately designed a visit to the
church of <i>Ephesus</i>, by name, Messieurs Whalley, Dunster,
Coventry, Ashe, Turner, Clotterbooke, Frye, and Chishull,
we had first a general meeting, to agree upon what was requisite
to the resolution we had taken; at which time Mr. Whalley kindly
undertaking the care of our provisions, and the government of our
intended journey, we propos’d to make a circuit of our way to
<i>Ephesus</i>, that so we might have a larger satisfaction in the sight
of those delightsome places, for which <i>Asia Minor</i> was always so
justly celebrated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> prosecution of this design we intended to make our first <i>conáck</i>
at <i>Norlícui</i>, to which place having this morning dispatched our baggage
upon mules, under the care of a <i>janisary</i> and two servants,
we ourselves set forward about three in the afternoon, with another
<i>janisary</i>, <i>dragoman</i>, servants, and other requisites. Our company
completed the number of twenty three light horse. Six or seven
other gentlemen of the English factory were pleased to accompany
us as far as <i>Norlícui</i>, where arriving in less than two hours, we all
found a kind and hospitable reception from Mr. Benjamin Jones
and his lady. After a short repast our freinds returned back to
<i>Smyrna</i>, and left us employed in providing for ourselves and horses.
This care had now taken up the evening, when it being proposed,
that morning and evening prayers should be constantly read to the
company during the whole journey, we all readily embraced the
motion. Hereupon we immediately put this design in execution,
and then pitched upon our lodging.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xxii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> morning a quarter before five we leave <i>Norlícui</i>, and proceed
on <i>Magnesia</i> road in our way to <i>St. George’s</i> village, expecting
to see the ceremonies, which the Greek Christians there perform on
the twenty third instant, which is the festival of that saint. And
having ascended the top of the adjoining hill, we there make an
halt for our mules, and take that opportunity of looking back, and
enjoying the delightful prospect, which this place afforded us. We
had then the gap of <i>Nymphe</i> on our left hand, and village of <i>Palamútcui</i>
on our right, which is pleasantly seated on an ascent, under
a grove of pine trees; but before us lay extended the whole plain
between the hills of <i>Tartalée</i><a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and <i>Cordilíeu</i>, being terminated with
the view of the <i>Two Brothers</i><a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, the city, castle, and bay of <i>Smyrna</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> continue our journey over the hill, till arriving at an old
burying place, we begin to descend by a paved way to a large and
high bridge of stone, built over a small, but clear and purling river.
From hence we pass on to the groves of <i>Jacácui</i>, which is a village
seated on the right hand upon an ascending ground, and fronting
the edge of <i>Tartalée</i>. Here we again halted, and drank a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
dish of coffee, partly to wait for our mules, and partly to entertain
ourselves with a view of the plain of <i>Nymphe</i>, into which we
had a narrow prospect between the forementioned village and the
ridge of the opposite mountain. After this we ascend a tedious
and craggy hill, with which tho we were now considerably fatigued,
yet we had still courage enough to reject the proposal,
which was there made, of baiting, and taking the advantage of a
fair commodious fountain, which flows on our right hand from
the top of the hill. We therefore proceed about the space of an
hour in tolerable good way, till at the descent of the mountain we
encounter a rugged and uneasy passage; the road being either
choaked up with loose stones, or else worn into abrupt and descending
steps. This obliged us to dismount, and lead our horses
down the precipice; where we nevertheless received some little
satisfaction, in observing the veins of red and white marble, with
which each side of this troublesome way is garnished. At the
foot of the hill we cross a rivulet, and quickly after repassing the
same, ride from thence strait forward in a covert and narrow bottom,
which in less than half an hour leads us into the plains of
<i>Magnesia</i>. After a short repast in this place we mount our
horses, turning to the left out of the road of <i>Magnesia</i>; and
tho we were now not more than half an hour from our
intended <i>conáck</i>, yet we ride on by mistake too much to the
right hand; till, having advanced beyond the town and castle
of <i>Magnesia</i>, we come to a Turkish village, where we were
directed almost back again to <i>St. George’s</i>. Here we arrived about
one a clock, and made it our first business to pitch our tent for
the use of our servants, whilst we ourselves were received into a
little house, which afforded us the convenience of one chamber,
and a <i>sophá</i>, for lodging.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">After</span> diner we took a walk about the village, and visited the
low humble church, which is here permitted to the Greek
Christians. It has outwardly the marks of no inconsiderable
antiquity, and within it is the exact model of the primitive
Greek churches; consisting first of the πρόναος or <i>outward
chapel</i>, then the νάος or <i>body of the church</i>, with three passages
from the one into the other, and after all a chancel separate
from the nave by lattice work. We here observed no other
ornaments, than the pictures of <i>St. George</i>, the <i>Virgin Mary</i>,
<i>St. John</i>, and <i>St. Nicholas</i>, and another of our <i>Savior</i> on the roof<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
of the church, which consists of a regular cupola. Before the
altar lay the book of the <i>Gospels</i>, with three or four copies of divine
service; some containing their ordinary <i>Liturgy</i>, and others adapted
to peculiar months of the year. The Greeks were now flocking
hither to perform their devotions before the picture of <i>St. George</i>;
and the superstition of a woman was remarkable, who prostrated
her little infant at the feet of the saint, and eagerly stroking the
picture endeavoured to convey some hidden blessing to the body
of the child.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xxiii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> morning we mounted about nine a clock, when the
Greeks were preparing for the ceremony of the day. It was pleasant
to see them flock together to the number of some thousands, being
of different sex, age, and quality; but all equally regardless
of the dirt and rain, which then fell very plentifully. We followed
them on horseback a little mile out of the village to a large
turpentine tree, under the shade and covert of which they had
placed the saints, which we had before observed in the church; and
there celebrated their mass. This was no other, than what is ordinary
in the rites of the Greek church; except only, that it seemed
to have some particular reference to <i>St. George</i>. It may be here
proper to observe, that as the priest made two elevations of the
elements, the one before, and the other after consecration; the
people equally adored them at the former, as well as at the latter<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.
Before the consecration of the wine was completed, the
priest mingled a little warm water in the cup, and afterwards put
the μαργαρίτης, or <i>consecrated bread</i>, therein. All which he, and
the deacon who assisted him, received; and after the whole ceremony
one of his assistants distributed two loaves of unconsecrated
bread<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> in little peices to the people, which they received with as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
much hurry as superstition. The congregation now break up,
and carry back their saints in a tumultuous manner, one still
endeavouring to catch them from another; while he that carries
them, runs with what speed he can, and often strikes his head
with the board, on which they are painted, as a voluntary
penance for his sins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> ceremony ended, we turned aside to satisfy our curiosity
with the sight of the famous river <i>Hermus</i>, which flows scarce
two bow’s shot below the turpentine tree mentioned above.
This large and noble river yeilds an entertaining sight, especially
when it abates something of its usual fulness. It appears graced
on each side with a sandy shelving bank. The neighbouring pastures
afford abundance of tamarisk, and on the edge of the river
asparagus is very plentiful. It may be observed, that as the poets
of old called it the <i>golden</i><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>, so the Turks at present call it the
<i>silver streamed Hermus</i>; either of which names it seems to deserve
from that bright and shining sand, which its water washes.
But though the sand be clear, yet the water is still thick and
muddy<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, and well answers some epithets of that nature, which
are bestowed upon it in ancient poetry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> was now past midday, when we return to the village, and
after the refreshment of a diner prepare for our departure towards
<i>Magnesia</i>. Our way thither lay through the same plain, into
which we entered yesterday at one a clock; where the beauty
and verdure of this campain countrey made amends for the
great rain, which annoyed us all this day, as well at the Greek
ceremony, as now in our way to <i>Magnesia</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> two hours from <i>St. George’s</i> we begin to enter <i>Magnesia</i>,
not without a just admiration of its delicious situation at the foot
of mount <i>Sipylus</i>; from whence it was antiently called <i>Magnesia
ad Sipylum</i>, to distinguish it from that other, which stood near
the river <i>Meander</i><a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. Having rode into the city, we began to
be in distress for an house to receive us; for an uncertain recommendation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
which we had hitherto over credulously relied on, we
now found to have miscarried. This was observed by an <i>effendi</i>,
who saw us pass under his window, and therefore courteously
acquainted us by his servant, that if we wanted accommodations,
we might be welcome to his house. We gladly embraced the
motion, and were conducted into a garden, where we were
afforded the use of a pleasure house, consisting of a large <i>sophá</i>
room, a kitchen, and an open <i>kiosk</i>, with a beautiful fountain
in the middle. The <i>effendi</i> himself came down, and welcomed
us to our apartment, adding withall, that if we had any other
freind to rely upon, he would not deprive us of a better entertainment;
if not, he bid us freely make use of what this place
afforded. Returning to his house he presented us with a lamb,
and desired to know, if there was any thing else, with which
he was capable of obliging us. By our <i>dragoman</i> he likewise informed
us, that the <i>cadí</i> of the city was at that time making
him a visit, before whom it might not be improper for us to shew
ourselves; but at the same time not to come empty handed.
According to this motion we waited upon the <i>cadí</i> with two <i>okes</i>
of sugar, and as many of coffee. He received us and our present
very obligingly; and upon the <i>effendi’s</i> invitation, we there
drank a dish of coffee in the company of several Turks, who
seemed to be of the better rank, and behaved themselves gentilely,
that is, according to the genius of this haughty people, with an
agreable mixture of civility and reservedness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> ceremony performed, we returned to our garden, and
there entertained ourselves at supper with just and grateful reflections
on the great courtesy and hospitality of our landlord,
whole name we had now learnt to be <i>Mahomet effendi</i>. His habitation
is very pleasant, yet not so much for the splendid furniture
of his house, as for that various and diverting prospect,
which it commands over the plain of <i>Hermus</i>; though indeed this
is an advantage, which by reason of the ascending situation of
<i>Magnesia</i> is common to the meanest cottage in the city. It seemed
strange to us to observe several pieces of painted glass in the
windows of our <i>effendi’s</i> house, inscribed in Turkish characters
with the name of the proprietor, together with some religious
sentences of Mahometan devotion. But we were much more
surprized, when we were informed, that it was the manufacture
of this place; for it is stained with a beautiful as well as deep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
and durable colour, and comes up to the perfection of the best,
we have seen in England. This gave us occasion to reflect on
the different fortune of arts and sciences, which, like men, seem
to take delight in shifting their station; for while other arts
have now left these places, and traveled westward, this alone in
exchange for all the rest seems to have retired into this, and is
deplored as lost in Christendom.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xxiv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> propose to spend this day at <i>Magnesia</i>, in order to observe
what may further occur there remarkable. To this end we were
favoured with the company of a <i>janisary</i> by one <i>Mahmút agá</i>,
to whom this morning we made a short visit; he being the person,
to whom at first we expected to have been recommended.
The <i>janisary</i> conducted us to the two principal <i>mosques</i> of the
city, to a religious college of <i>dervíses</i>, to a madhouse, and to an
old <i>seraglio</i>, where the young princes of the Ottoman empire
have formerly been educated. At the last of these there remain
only the reliques of two or three rich <i>tiváns</i>, and a considerable
number of stately old cypress trees, to witness the former grandeur
of the place. At the madhouse we could observe nothing besides
the bare walls of that hospital, and a brass mortar lying in the
yard, which seemed to be remarkable for an old Latin inscription,
which it bore, signifying that <i>it was made at Pisa</i>.
The religious college is a fair stone building, consisting of one
quadrangle, and that encompassed with a regular cloister, which
is supported with pillars of the modern Greek module. The two
<i>mosques</i>, which we mentioned, are distinguished from the rest,
in that they are of royal foundation, an honour which is signified
by the two <i>minarées</i> belonging to them; whereas the other
eighteen, with which this city is furnished, have but one a
piece. Before each of these <i>mosques</i> there is a square and regular
area, containing a beautiful fountain in the middle, and enclosed
on three sides with cells of religious Turks. The front
of the <i>mosque</i> makes the fourth side of the square, and is itself
likewise adorned with a spacious portico supported with stately
pillars, of which some only are topt with modern capitals. But
as the capitals of the rest are of the old Corinthian order, so all
the shafts appear plainly to be ancient; some consisting of natural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
and others of cast artificial marble, but both the one and the
other bound near the pedestal with rings of massy brass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Before</span> we could be admitted into the inside, we were obliged
to comply with the zeal of the Turks, who always leave
their shoes at the entrance of their <i>mosques</i>. Here we found
them both much resembling one another, excepting that one
was richer than the other; and whereas the roof of the
other consisted of five cupolas, the roof of this was regularly
contracted into one. We had now the liberty to view several
copies of their <i>Alcoran</i>, and other books of Mahometan
prayers, all curiously written and adorned with golden figures.
The windows are furnished with excellent painted glass, full of
flower work and religious inscriptions; and from the roof hangs
a multitude of lamps, together with bright balls contrived to reflect
the light, all of them well ranged in a beautiful and artificial
manner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> each of the royal <i>mosques</i> we further observed a splendid
<i>kiblé</i>, which is a part separate from the body of the <i>mosque</i>, and
answering to the altar of our Christian churches; it is adorned
with a rich floor and gilded roof, together with carving and
mosaic work on each side, but more particularly in the front,
which is contrived to face <i>Mecca</i>. Immediately to the right
hand of the <i>kiblé</i> stands a lofty pulpit, being fourteen steps
high, and consisting of a portal, rails, and canopy, all of
wrought marble. One thing was remarkable as well in these
<i>mosques</i>, as in that which we afterwards saw at <i>Ephesus</i>, though
we know not whether it has any mystical reference to the
Turkish superstition; it is a nich in the front of the <i>kiblé</i>, on
each side of which stands a fine slender pillar, hewn out of one
entire stone, made without capital or pedestal, but so fixed within
the work both above and below, that it remains moveable, and
is turned about by the hand at pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> sight of <i>Magnesia</i> was our employment before diner,
but in the afternoon we all attempted to ascend the castle hill
on foot; which we quickly found to be a more difficult and
painful task, than we at first imagined. The way was inexpressibly
steep and craggy, and cost us an hour’s labour, though
we made all possible speed; nor after our return could we blame<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
the discretion of one of our companions, who thought fit to retire
about the midway. However having at length conquered the
ascent, our toil was well rewarded with the surprizing prospect of
the city, and adjacent plain; in the latter of which we could
distinguish the whole course of the <i>Hermus</i> for many miles together,
as also the places where the <i>Amnis Phrygius</i>, or <i>Hyllus</i>,
joins it<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> fabric of the whole castle is very strong, and the advantage
of a hill, which is on all sides a mile high, must have rendered
it impregnable, in an age which knew not the use of gunpowder.
It was formerly fortified with a considerable number
of great guns, which are now removed to the new castle, which
defends the bay of <i>Smyrna</i>. Two only remain on a bastion, that
fronts the city; on both which we were sorry to see the eagles of
the Roman empire. No other apartment of the castle is now
kept locked, except a dungeon, in which there were twelve prisoners,
lately sent thither by <i>Osmánogli</i>. A sight of these miserable
wretches we desired of the <i>agá</i>, nor was he so scrupulous as
to deny it us. The same <i>agá</i> likewise shewed us within the
precincts of the castle a poor Christian church, dedicated to the
memory of <i>St. John</i>; where the Greeks meet upon the day of
his feast, and are at the constant charge of two lamps, which burn
there throughout the year. We had read and heard of a collection
of Roman arms, reserved somewhere in this castle; tho being
upon the place, nothing of this nature occurred to us. But <i>Solymán
effendi</i>, a most courteous and obliging person, whom we
visited this evening, as being the next neighbour, as well as brother
of our landlord, assured us, that having many years since had
the curiosity to ascend the castle hill, he then saw under ground
the collection which we spake of, consisting of headpieces, breastplates,
shields, and the like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> mountainous parts about <i>Magnesia</i> were antiently famous
for the production of the loadstone<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>; tho indeed it is disparaged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
by <i>Pliny</i><a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, and accounted less attractive, than that of other places.
However this probably was the city, from whence, as <i>Lucretius</i> says,
that stone took the name of <i>magnet</i><a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>; as from the whole country
of <i>Lydia</i> the touchstone likewise was called <i>lapis Lydius</i><a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. This
hint gave us the curiosity to carry a sea compass up the castle
hill, where we had the satisfaction to see it point to different
quarters, as we then placed it upon different stones, and quickly
after intirely to lose its whole virtue; two effects which are natural
to the magnetic needle, when injured by the nearness of
other bodies impregnated with the same quality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Late</span> in the evening we were now preparing for repose, and
endeavouring to forget the fatigue of the castle hill; when <i>Solymán
effendi</i>, having laid aside the badges of his character, and
put on a more familiar temper, returned our visit. We doubted
not from the change of his habit, and the unseasonableness of the
hour, but he came to break a Mahometan commandment, and
<i>steal his kief</i> (as the Turks pleasantly express it) in the juice of
the forbidden grape<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. This was a tedious and ungrateful task,
with which nevertheless, by reason of his own and his brother’s
great civility, some of our company were forced to comply. Nor
had the wine he freely drank its desired effect, till towards two a
clock in the morning.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xxv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> begin to rise by five this morning, and after dispatching
our baggage take leave of <i>Mahomet effendi</i>, to whose singular
humanity and hospitality we had hitherto been so much obliged.
As we were riding thro the city, it was pleasant to recollect something
of the ancient history of this place, whose present state we
had seen the day before. It there occurred to us, that this was
that <i>Magnesia</i>, which of all the Asian cities<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> made the first submission
to the Roman arms, after the defeat of <i>Antiochus</i> by <i>Scipio</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
This likewise was that <i>Magnesia</i>, which entered into a league offensive
and defensive with the city of <i>Smyrna</i> in the reign of
<i>Seleucus</i> son of <i>Antiochus Theus</i>, whereby the inhabitants of the
one were mutually made free of the other city; and whereas public
monuments of this confederacy were by agreement of both parties
to be erected in different places, one of them, which was set
up by the <i>Smyrneans</i>, is now to be seen in the gallery at <i>Oxford</i>,
inscribed on a large flat marble pillar<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">There</span> now scarce occur any reliques of antiquity in <i>Magnesia</i>,
except that we observed several Ionic and Corinthian pillars in the
court of an old <i>mosque</i>, held in great veneration by the Turks for
the burial of <i>Hasánogli</i>, a person famous in the history of that
nation. Over one of the entrances into the same court there is
to be seen a broken inscription of an antient heathen temple, tho
too high to be now legible; and on a stone step, placed before
the principal <i>mosque</i> of the city, we could read among other decayed
words ΚΑΙΣΑΡΙ ΣΕΒΑΣΤΩ. The following inscription likewise
is of no contemptible antiquity, which we found on a stone
now lying in the staircase of the abovementioned <i>Solymán effendi</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">The said <i>effendi</i> not only civilly informed us of this stone, but
when we had transcribed the words, he profered to send it after
us to <i>Smyrna</i>; adding, that if it was any piece of sanctity, he
was unwilling it should remain there to be trampled under foot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Designing</span> from hence for <i>Durguthli</i>, we continue our journey
under the foot of <i>Sipylus</i>, which about two hours from the city
ends in a stupendous precipice, consisting of a naked massy stone,
and rising perpendicularly almost a furlong high. It was not a
little surprizing, as we rode along under the foot of this hill, to
observe a certain cliff of the rock, representing an exact nich and
statue, with the due shape and proportion of an human body. For
<i>Sipylus</i> being the seat of the transformation of the unhappy <i>Niobe</i><a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>,
there was ground of imagining, that we had either met with her
statue, or with that which was the first occasion of the fable; at
least it was not improbable, that this was the work of some antient
inhabitants of this place, who pleased themselves in fashioning
the natural rock into such a figure, as might preserve the tradition
of this celebrated poetic fiction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Not</span> far from hence we begin to leave the mountain on our
right hand, having the stream of the <i>Hermus</i> in view on the left;
and at a large distance before us the snowy top of the mountain
<i>Tmolus</i>. Our road now lay thro a verdant and delightful plain,
inriched by many advantages of nature, and not negligently manured
by the inhabitants. About the fourth hour of this day’s
journey we passed a bridge, erected over a large river; which, as
those of the country informed us, is now called <i>Niphti</i>, or <i>Nymphe</i>,
and may probably be the <i>Cryos</i> mentioned by <i>Pliny</i>, as one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
streams that feed the <i>Hermus</i><a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. From this bridge the road lies
thro a less fertile plain, till within the neighbourhood of <i>Durguthli</i>
it is again better cultivated, and appropriated to the production
of cottons. Near our entrance into the town we cross a
broad and sandy chanel, which in the winter season conveys no
inconsiderable current into the <i>Hermus</i>. We had here no other to
rely upon, than the accommodations of a public <i>kane</i>, where, after
we had fixed our lodgings, we found that we had arrived in
six hours from <i>Magnesia</i>; tho an hour is to be deducted for the
rests, which we were obliged to make for the security of our mules.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Durguthli</span> is a town purely of Turkish fabric, and therefore
has nothing to entertain the curiosity of any traveler, besides the
management of cotton wool; which is here prepared in great abundance,
and so transmitted to the market of <i>Smyrna</i>. As to
this we observed, that they first sift it from the dust and other refuse,
which it contracts in gathering, in a large wicker wheel;
after this they separate the wool from the cod, in which it grows;
and at last they work it betwixt a wooden and iron roller, which
spinning upon one another in a rapid motion draw in the wool,
and leave the seed behind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Walking</span> up and down about the limits of our <i>kane</i>, we were
accosted by a Turk, who spake good Italian. He had been many
years a slave in <i>Legorn</i>, where he was a witness to the riches and
splendor of Italy, and other parts of Christendom. This gave
him occasion to express a just indignation against the haughty
ignorance of the Turks; who, tho they want all advantages of
art, and appearance of true magnificence, yet have the vanity to
despise other nations, who enjoy both to a great perfection. In
other discourse with an Armenian priest we were informed of a
church, which by a peculiar grant of the <i>Grand Signior</i> that nation
had newly founded in <i>Durguthli</i>. This was an instance,
which seemed to us observable; for tho Christianity is tolerated
in Turkey, yet they hold it inconsistent with their law to permit
the erection of any new churches, and allow only the liberty
of repairing old ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> parted in the close of the evening, and repaired in good
health to our respective lodgings. But about two in the morning
one of our company awaked under an indisposition, which
by degrees grew into a severe and dangerous sickness; tho by
timely opening a vein, and after that enjoying a little repose, he
recovered to the great satisfaction of the whole company. However
this discouraged us from proceeding, till another night’s rest
should confirm his health. Being thus detained a day at <i>Durguthli</i>,
we were informed of some antiquities to be seen among
the Armenian graves, on a mount adjoining to the town; whither
when we had repaired, we found a curious piece of <i>basso
relievo</i>, brought, as they said, from <i>Sardis</i>. But no ancient inscriptions
appeared there, except these imperfect words on a marble
tombstone.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xxvii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Rising</span> early this morning all of us, God be thanked, in perfect
health, we still resolve to enlarge our circuit; whence Mr.
Coventry and Mr. Frye apprehending too long a journey, determined
to return to <i>Smyrna</i>. The remaining part of our company
proceed by break of day in the road for <i>Sardis</i>. Just before
we arrive at the fountain on our right hand, about half an hour
from our <i>conáck</i>, lies the village of <i>Ishmaeljá</i>. And in an hour
and an half from thence we observe <i>Urgánlui</i> on the left. We
continue our journey thro a spatious and fertile plain, curiously
beset on each side the road with variety of round hillocks, which
from their number, figure, and situation, in so level a campain,
appear plainly to be artificial. They are undoubtedly the work
of one or more numerous armies; but whether they were at first
designed to bury their heaps of slain<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> (which was the original of
those barrows<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>, that occur in many plains of England) or whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
they were erected as thrones before the pavilion of the general,
which was usual in the Roman camp<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, is not easy to determine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">About</span> the fourth hour crossing a small river we have the village
of <i>Baricle</i> on the left hand, and larger than that, the village of
<i>Achmetléer</i> on the right. Not far from hence the road divides
into two paths for <i>Sardis</i>. The lower of these we chose, tho
declining a little too much to the left hand, and so passing by a
few cottages, which are called by the name of <i>Zericle</i>, we arrive
in seven hours at <i>Sardis</i>, one of which is now likewise to be
deducted for the stay, which our mules occasioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Instead</span> of that <i>Sardis</i>, which antiently was the seat of the kings
of <i>Lydia</i>, afterwards in great renown, under the Persian, Grecian,
and Roman Empires, and at last honoured with the title of a Metropolitan
Christian church; we now find in the same place, at
the foot of mount <i>Tmolus</i>, a small Turkish village by the name
of <i>Sart</i>. We here had the liberty of a ruinous inconvenient <i>kane</i>,
erected in this place for the service of <i>caraváns</i> from Persia; but
we much rather embraced the opportunity of pitching our tents
under the covert of a few plane trees, which spread a cool and
grateful shade upon the bank of <i>Pactólus</i>. This river is constantly
mentioned as rising in <i>Tmolus</i>, and washing the Walls of <i>Sardis</i>,
particularly it is said by <i>Herodotus</i> to run thro the very market
place of the ancient city<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. Its chanel does not now appear
to be considerable, yet it deserved our particular notice for the
fame of its golden streams; a story celebrated not more by poets<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
than historians, the latter of whom have imagined this to be the
treasure, whence <i>Croesus</i> and his ancestors collected that mighty
wealth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Before</span> the cool of the evening we visited the ruins of this once
flourishing city; and towards the western part observed the
standing walls of two or three spatious and lofty rooms, not unworthy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
the palace of the ancient kings of <i>Lydia</i>. They were
all arched towards the foundation, and adorned as well as
strengthened at each corner with hewn stone; but the main part
of the fabric consisted of a broad and durable brick, which is
likewise observable in most of the ancient ruins of <i>Asia Minor</i>.
From hence we passed thro heaps of rubbish, and tracks of continued
foundations, to the eastern part of the city; where stand
the pillars and front of another spatious building, the figure and
situation of which persuaded us, that they were the remains of
the cathedral church. A little southerly from hence we viewed
the full extent of another stately room, which however antient
it might be, was nevertheless raised out of ruins more antient than
itself; as appeared from several rich pillars, and architraves, confusedly
placed among the rubbish of the walls. About the distance
of a furlong, full south of the antient city, are to be seen the
beautiful remains not of an amphitheatre, as has been supposed, but
rather of some royal palace. Here we observed six lofty Ionic
pillars, all of them still intire, except that the capital of one is
distorted by an earthquake. There adjoins to them a fair and
magnificent portal, the pilasters of which, being about twenty
feet high, and twelve feet distant from each other, are joined at
the top by one entire stone, which, by what art or force it was
there erected, is difficult to conceive; for tho <i>Pliny</i><a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> pretends to
account for the like difficulty in the architecture of the temple of
<i>Ephesus</i>, yet that passage gives but little satisfaction in the matter.
There occurs nothing else, that is remarkable about <i>Sardis</i>,
besides the broken walls of the castle on an adjoining hill; the
ascent and prospect of which, however magnified by Sir <i>Paul
Rycaut</i>, we yet thought so inferior, to what we lately had found
at <i>Magnesia</i>, that it could not raise our curiosity to undertake the
climbing of that precipice, especially since we could promise ourselves
the same prospect to a greater advantage from the top of
<i>Tmolus</i>; and as for two or three broken inscriptions, which are
there extant, we were content to peruse them in Dr. <i>Smith’s</i>
printed <i>Journal</i><a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xxviii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> had now determined our course for <i>Birghée</i>, towards which
our way lay over the mountain <i>Tmolus</i>. In pursuance of this design
we mounted quickly after three this morning, and by that
time it was full day we had ascended the first edge of the hill,
where we halted to enjoy the entertaining prospect of the plain
of <i>Sardis</i>. We had here the opportunity of viewing the castle
hill, the antient seat of the city, the whole course of the <i>Hermus</i><a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>,
and the full extent of the <i>Gygaean lake</i>, about five miles in
length, and three in breadth, mentioned in all ancient accounts of
<i>Sardis</i>; but what renders it most remarkable, celebrated of old by
<i>Homer</i><a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>, and well described by <i>Strabo</i> to be about forty furlongs
from the city<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. This sight had now highly satisfied our curiosity,
when we turn to the right hand more into the body of the hill,
and contrary to our expectation rarely encounter any difficult
ascent, by reason of the artificial windings of the way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Tmolus</span> is in general so pleasant, that it was easy to conceive
ourselves in a theatre, where the scene changes every half hour;
for sometimes we were surprized with an impending rock, sometimes
with a perpendicular precipice, and sometimes with the
murmurs of a falling brook; the whole being curiously garnished
with trees, shrubs, and herbs of an infinite variety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> four hours we had at length conquered the highest eminence
of the mountain, whence we continue our journey thro a fruitful
vale, enclosed on each side with two lofty ridges of the hill.
On each of these remains a large quantity of snow, which, as
it gradually melts, supplies a rapid current, that descends hence
into <i>Pactólus</i>. It was observable, that the air of the whole vale
was chilled to that degree by the neighbouring snows, that it was
still winter in this place; nor could we here discern any buds or
leaves on the same sorts of trees, which we had seen green and
flourishing on the kinder parts of the mountain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> cool and refreshing vale lasted an hour, after which we
begin to descend the hill by a more steep and dangerous way, than
we before had mounted; but nothing was more disagreable,
than so sensible a change of air, which we now experienced, being
as it were at once translated out of the frigid into the torrid zone.
Such was the difference betwixt the valley we had left, and the
southern part of the hill we were now traveling. This heat being
added to the laborious and tedious circuits, without which the
descent was absolutely impossible, brought us at length by one of
the clock almost half dead to <i>Birghée</i>. Nor were we capable of
being refreshed, either with the remembrance of that pleasant
mountain, we had passed; or with the view of the <i>Caýstrian</i> plain,
which we had then before us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> rich products of mount <i>Tmolus</i> ought not here to be
forgot<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>, which nature has furnished with that store and variety of
plants, that it may deservedly be termed the <i>physic garden</i> of the
universe. The valley, which we mentioned, is enriched with a
vein of marble, clear and pellucid enough to contend with alabaster.
Nor is it to be neglected, that on the southern descent
of the hill we traveled over a continued track of stone, adorned
with bright and shining particles resembling gold dust; the occasion
most probably of so many splendid epithets, which in antient
poetry are bestowed on the <i>Pactólus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Birghée</span> is a fair and considerable Turkish town, adorned with
two very handsome <i>mosques</i>; and pleasantly seated in the road
from <i>Sardis</i>, at the opposite foot of <i>Tmolus</i>. This makes it probable,
it was the <i>Hypaepae</i> of the antients, that situation exactly
answering to the description, which <i>Ovid</i> and <i>Strabo</i> have left us
of it<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. We were here received into a public <i>kane</i>, where we enjoyed
an hearty and entire repose; tho sweetened rather by the
fatigue of the foregoing day, than any entertainment or accommodation
of the place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xxix.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> continued our journey by four a clock this morning thro the
<i>Caýstrian</i> plain for <i>Tyria</i>, and had the satisfaction of fording that
celebrated river about three hours from our <i>conáck</i>. Not far
from hence we found a stone bridge of three considerable arches,
built directly along the bank of the river; and therefore now serving
to no other purpose, but only to witness that the stream had
changed its chanel. Our way lay from hence near the course
of the <i>Caýster</i>, thro a fertile and well cultivated champain; a
place inexpressibly delicious, and which can be equalled by nothing,
but the sweetness of that immortal verse:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is inhabited by frequent villages, and enclosed on both sides
with two high and snowy mountains, namely <i>Tmolus</i> on the
right hand, and on the left what <i>Strabo</i> calls Μεσογειότης<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>, or the
<i>Midland hills</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Soon</span> after eleven a clock we arrived at <i>Tyria</i>, and <i>conácked</i> in
an old, dirty, ruinous <i>kane</i>; having by this time learnt, that the
weary and thirsty traveler must repine at no reception, which he
meets with in Turkey. <i>Tyria</i> yeilds a pleasant prospect, as we
ride into the city, gently ascending from the adjacent plain.
The buildings are curiously intermixt with trees and gardens,
which extend the circuit of the place; tho the number of its
houses seems inferior to that of <i>Smyrna</i>. We counted about fourteen
<i>mosques</i>, one of which we observed to be royal, that is, adorned
with a double <i>minarée</i>. Having entered the town we found
the streets negligently kept, and meanly built; but at the same time
populous enough, not without the appearance of a considerable
trade. It is to be wondered that so large a city, standing in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
very heart of Asia, should have no remains of antiquity<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>. There
are indeed two Greek churches in the place, where the poor ignorant
priests would persuade both themselves and us, that this
was the antient <i>Thyatira</i>; but we thought it not fit to rob them
of the satisfaction of this error, nor puzzle them with any accounts
of antient geography, or late experience, that evince the contrary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> is pretended in some journals, that two or three valuable
inscriptions are to be found in these churches, tho we were now
eye witnesses of the contrary; for there occur’d nothing in that,
which they call the Metropolitan church, but a defaced monument,
whereon no intelligible words were to be read, except
ΧΡΗΣΤΕ ΧΑΙΡΕ. Over the entrance of the other there is a piece
of devotion, written in modern characters: but more remarkable,
in the body of the wall stands a large image of our <i>Savior</i>, elegantly
carved in porphyry; tho it now appears rudely mangled,
and seems to have felt the fury of the old angry <i>iconoclastae</i>. In
the hand is portrayed an open book, inscribed with this sentence
out of <i>St. John’s</i> Gospel, viii. 12. Ἐγώ εἰμι τὸ φῶς τοῦ
κόσμου. This was an instance, which may perhaps appear to be
singular, at least it is contrary to the general practice, as well as
persuasion of the Greek church; for tho they have a superstitious
fondness for religious pictures, yet they abhor all imagery in <i>relievo</i>,
and look upon it as inclining to heathenism and idolatry.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xxx.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> six this morning we set forward from <i>Tyria</i> in our way for
<i>Ephesus</i>, and passing thro the extreme skirt of the city, we observe
the inscription of an ancient stone coffin, now converted by the
Turks to supply the use of a cistern. It has been defaced towards
the upper parts of the chest, and permitted us to read only these
following words:</p>

<div class="inscription-container">

<div class="line-l">ΑΡΧΕΙΟΝ</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Upon</span> the borders of the road, about a mile from <i>Tyria</i>, there
stands a commodious fountain, and adjoining thereto a pleasant
country house; where, as we staid to drink, an hospitable old Turk
offered us the entertainment of the place. We were then obliged
to refuse the favour, but not without a fresh regret at the inconveniency
of our last night’s lodging, when we might have easily
passed on to this advantagous <i>conáck</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> hence travel some hours in a narrow and almost deserted
vale, the <i>Caýster</i> still flowing on our right hand; till about one
a clock we draw near to the extreme edge of the <i>Alymán</i>, a large
mountain lying betwixt the city of <i>Ephesus</i> and the village of
<i>Giamobasy</i>, and here ending in an abrupt precipice; on the top
of which stands an old castle now converted, as is said, into a
college of <i>dervíses</i>. Near this place the <i>Caýster</i> mingles with
a large and muddy lake, which most probably was the <i>Stagnum
Pegasaeum</i>, mentioned by <i>Pliny</i><a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>, as having communication with
this river. The <i>Alymán</i> we take to be the <i>Mons Gallesius</i> of
the antients<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>; since the <i>Mimas</i><a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>, for which some have lately mistaken
it, is the highest part of <i>Erythréa</i>, or that cape land, which
encloses the bay of <i>Smyrna</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> now thought it more advisable not to reach <i>Ephesus</i> till
the cool of the morning, but to pass this evening at <i>Kirkingécui</i>,
a Christian village, lying near two hours to the east of the city.
In search of this place our guide unfortunately led us to the left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
of the above mentioned lake, up a steep craggy and almost impassible
mountain; which when with great difficulty we had conquered,
and descended in a way almost as tedious on the other
side, we were acquainted by a traveler, that we were out of our
road either to <i>Ephesus</i> or <i>Kirkingécui</i>. This struck a damp upon
our spirits, being now obliged to tread back so many unwelcome
steps in the heat of the day, despair of all present refreshment,
and fearful apprehensions of the miscarriage of our mules.
It was therefore voted necessary to hire the above mentioned traveler
to conduct us to our village, who accordingly led us by a
long and tedious way almost under the castle of <i>Ephesus</i>. But
from hence we had an hour and an half of pleasant and diverting
riding, betwixt two shelving hills, watered at the bottom with a
purling brook; whilst on each side we were entertained with a
shady scene of bays, myrtle, oleander, Spanish broom, the plane
tree, Judas tree, the strawberry tree, lilach tree, and a multitude
of other delightful greens. The frequent stops and misfortunes
of this day’s journey had made it almost eight a clock, when we
arrived at <i>Kirkingécui</i>; where to our incredible satisfaction we
found our tents already pitched by our muliteers, who by an
unknown and unbeaten path, over two or three mountains, had
at last fallen upon the village, more by good fortune than any
conduct of their own.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> i. 1699.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> village of <i>Kirkingécui</i> is intirely Christian, and supposed
to be the miserable remains of the church of <i>Ephesus</i>. The
παπᾶς, or <i>priest</i>, here pretended to shew us a venerable manuscript
of the <i>Evangelists</i>, wrote, as he said, by <i>Prochorus</i>, one of
the <i>seven deacons</i>, mentioned in the <i>Acts of the Apostles</i><a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. Upon
inspection the character indeed appeared antient, and possibly
may be that of the sixth or seventh century; but the book itself
is nothing else but a <i>Lectionarium</i>, or <i>Copy of the Gospels</i>, so portioned
into lessons, according to the ritual of the Greek church,
that, begining at <i>St. John</i> on Easter day, the four <i>Evangelists</i> are
read out by the return of the year. The sight of that manuscript,
and of the small parish church, was the business of this morning;
after which we descended by the same pleasant road, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
we had traveled last night, and so arriving about ten a clock we
take possession of the public <i>kane</i> at <i>Ephesus</i><a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> once glorious and renowned <i>Ephesus</i> was seated in a fruitful
vale, encompassed almost round with mountains<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>, at a small
distance from the <i>Caýster</i>, and about five miles eastward from cape
<i>Trogilium</i>; where, at the common charge of all <i>Ionia</i>, the <i>Panionia</i>,
or <i>common councils of Ionia</i>, were formerly celebrated. This
vale rises advantagously in the middle with two or three little
hills<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>, on which the several parts of the antient city lay extended.
The same spot of ground is still covered with the rich remains of
its former glory. Such are the massy walls, the portals, the arches,
the aqueducts, the marble chests, together with the dejected cornishes,
shafts, and capitals of many lofty pillars. But the face
of the whole yeilds a melancholy and disagreable prospect, being
overrun with an incredible quantity of rank and luxuriant weeds,
which serve only to corrupt the air, and to conceal the curiosities
of the place. This we found to be a disadvantagous circumstance,
and such as doubled the labour of this day in compassing
the circuit of the city, and tracing the uncertain footsteps of so
many valuable antiquities. But because these cannot so intelligibly
be represented in the order, in which we viewed them, we
shall methodically consider <i>Ephesus</i>, as lying in three distinct
ruins of a Turkish, Christian, and Heathen city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> freshest ruins of this place appear to be Turkish, and such
as witness, that it has been in considerable repute even under its
last barbarous conqueror; who also has changed the name of
<i>Ephesus</i> into that of <i>Aiasalúck</i>. Here are to be seen the remains
of five or six <i>mosques</i>, besides one which is still used for Mahometan
service. In several places there occur the walls of ruined
bagnios, tho they are incredibly increased by the fabulous Turks,
and reported to have been here to the number of three hundred
and sixty six. But that, which most plainly evidences the late
riches of the place, are the many beautiful monuments, which
we viewed among their burying places, most of them inscribed
with fair Turkish characters. Tis observable, that these are cut<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
rising from the plane of the stone, and not indented within the
surface; which is the constant fashion of the Turks in all their
public monuments, in opposition to the custom of other times
and nations. It is not certain, whether the new castle, which
stands to the northward of the old citadel, be of Grecian or Turkish
fabric; however it is still kept in repair by the Turks, and
filled within the circuit of the walls with fifty or sixty small cottages,
which with two or three scattering tenements are the only
habitations of the present <i>Ephesus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">For</span> such monuments of Christianity, as are here visited by
travelers, we are beholden to the tradition of the neighbouring
Christians; who shew the place of <i>St. Mark’s</i> and <i>St. Paul’s</i>
church, together with the standing walls of that dedicated to <i>St.
John</i>; which last apostle, returning from his banishment in <i>Patmos</i>
upon the death of <i>Domitian</i>, lived, and died, and was interred
at <i>Ephesus</i><a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>. The church of <i>St. John</i>, tho still entire, is however
miserably transformed, and converted into the profane use of
a Turkish <i>mosque</i>. Like all other <i>mosques</i> of the better fashion,
it has a square and spacious yard on the north side, with three
different entrances belonging to it. Those to the east and west
are reasonably well beautified, being adorned above the portals
with curious Turkish sculptures, and materials of rich polished
marble. From this yard we enter the <i>mosque</i> by five wooden
doors, all of which are carved to an exquisite perfection. Within
appear a splendid pulpit and <i>kiblé</i>, both consisting of wrought
marble, and the latter more particularly imbellished with painting
and gilding of great art and variety. But what are most
justly admired and celebrated by all, who have traveled hither,
are the four pillars of granate marble, standing in a right line from
east to west, and supporting two cupolas, that compose the roof.
They are so far disproportioned, that the least is almost three,
and the biggest near four feet diameter; besides which the pedestals
of some are quite covered with the floor, and all besides one,
which is of the compound order, have lost their antient capitals.
All these are circumstances, which unanswerably demonstrate,
that these pillars are now transported from their first places. And
in truth, when the whole fabric is diligently compared with all
other Turkish <i>mosques</i>, and this consideration further added, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
there appears no sign of an altar to the east, or door to the west
end; it will be more than probable, that nothing but the southern
wall can be the remains of a Christian church. About a
mile to the south west of this place, and in the midst of the antient
city, stands an high wall, and adjoining thereto a stately
gatehouse, in which are these words, most curiously engraven:</p>

<div class="inscription-container">
<div class="inscription">
<div class="line-c">.... ACCENSO ....</div>
<div class="line-j">.... RENSI ET ASIAE ...</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Together with this imperfect inscription are to be seen the defaced
figure of a man on horseback, and another of a serpent
twisted round a tree. This is by most adjudged to be a Christian
ruin; and indeed if we consider its beauty and grandeur, as it
can be no very modern building, so by reason of its misplaced
carvings and inverted inscriptions it cannot be very antient; but
may conveniently be refered to those times, in which Christianity
began to flourish here. And after this there will be room to put
in another conjecture, and to guess from the stateliness of the fabric,
that it might be the place, where that famous general council
of almost two hundred bishops condemned the heresy of <i>Nestorius</i>,
in the year four hundred thirty one; tho his errors are
still living among the Indians and Chaldeans, two sects which are
numerous in the eastern parts of <i>Asia</i><a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>. Those other Christian
monuments, which are commonly shewn at <i>Ephesus</i>, are merely
fabulous; and serve only to cheat and abuse the curiosity of many
travelers, who undergo no little pains and difficulty in coming hither.
Such are the <i>cave of the seven sleepers</i>; the <i>font</i>, in which
<i>St. John</i> is said to have baptized so many primitive Christians;
and a square watch tower, which ordinarily goes by the name of
<i>St. Paul’s prison</i>. This last stands upon a small hill, about a mile
nearer the sea, than was the <i>temple of Diana</i>; and is indeed worth
visiting by those, who have not so much superstition or credulity;
for its situation gives a commanding prospect over the stream
of the <i>Caýster</i>, which here seems to rival the <i>Maeander</i>, and plays
with many wanton windings in the adjoining plain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> chief heathen antiquities, that are to be seen at <i>Ephesus</i>,
are the remainder of the <i>old citadel</i>, and the foundation of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
<i>temple of Diana</i>. The former of these is an intire gate, with two
broken walls adjoining on each side, which being situated on a
convenient ascent, towards the north east of the ancient city,
most probably was a sort or citadel, that defended it on that
quarter. This gatehouse has the marks of considerable antiquity,
tho it has been rebuilt from other more antient ruins; as is evident
from some misplaced stones, and broken reversed inscriptions,
that occur in the work. Among these are viewed with great
satisfaction three flat marble stones, curiously cut in <i>basso relievo</i>;
which tho of different design, and unequal breadth, are placed
in a line to adorn the arch of the gate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> first of these marbles (reckoning from the left hand as we
front the gate) has been somewhat injured by time; but from
the portraiture of grapes and baskets, and four or five figures in
gay and youthful postures, it may be presumed to represent a
<i>Bacchanal</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> second marble is a military piece, consisting of many intire
figures, all cut in postures very bold and masterly, and such
as undoubtedly are the work of some noble hand. It designs a
warlike horse surprized by an enemy, with his rider lying at his
feet; near which several persons are carried captive by Roman
soldiers. The chieftain stands by, and is supplicated by a woman
in a large loose mantle, whose intercession seems to intercept the
action. This has been by some refered to the <i>destruction of Troy</i>,
and by others to a Christian persecution; but with greater probability
it may be thought to represent the event of some Roman
victory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> third marble is a sepulchral monument, and represents a
dead person extended, from his knees upwards, on a funeral bed;
the chief mourner sitting, and five other persons standing in a
melancholy posture, and lamenting over him. These likewise are
very lively figures, and cut with an inimitable perfection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Of</span> the <i>temple of Diana</i> there are extant no considerable ruins,
nor any thing that is lofty and beautiful enough to bespeak it
the remains of that famous structure. But in a marshy ground,
near the <i>Lacus Selenusius</i><a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>, betwixt the haven <i>Panórmus</i><a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
place of the antient city, there stand two broken pieces of a massy
wall, in which both the present tradition, and accounts of antient
geographers, exactly conspire to prove them the small reliques of
the temple. As they themselves consist of square hewn stone, so
they are surrounded with heaps of the same materials, among
which occur some lofty dejected pillars of beautiful and splendid
marble. Under the highest of these ruinous walls there descends
an artificial passage, which after two or three short turnings proceeds
in a straight line thro many narrow rooms and alleys. This,
tho dark and noisome, is customarily visited by travelers, with
the assistance of a candle and clue of thread; and is called, by
we know not what fancy, the <i>labyrinth of Diana’s temple</i>. But
as we observed the like under several large structures, some at
<i>Sardis</i>, and others at this very place; so it is notorious, that this
is but the ordinary method of strengthening any great foundation,
and securing the building by subterraneous arches. Returning
from this cavity the traveler has nothing else in view, but venerable
heaps of rubbish, and uncertain traces of foundations; and must
be forced to supply his curiosity with considering, that this was
the place, where once stood and flourished that renowned wonder
of the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> first temple had been burnt on the same night, in which
<i>Alexander the Great</i> was born; and this second was then rebuilding,
when that prince was residing at <i>Ephesus</i>, and pursuing his
conquests in <i>Asia Minor</i>. He contributed sumptuously to the expence,
and afterwards proposed to reimburse the whole, if the
Ephesians would consent to inscribe his name upon the fabric<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.
But those citizens had an ambition equal to that of Alexander,
and therefore diverted his desires by a fulsom compliment, and
the dedication of a famous picture; which was Alexander himself
armed with thunder, designed by the inimitable Apelles, and
valued at twenty talents of gold<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. <i>Pliny</i> has likewise told us,
that this temple was adorned with an hundred and twenty seven
pillars, each sixty feet high, thirty six of which were carved, and
that by the celebrated hand of <i>Scopas</i>. The whole structure was
four hundred and twenty five feet in length, and two hundred
and twenty feet in breadth; and was founded in this watry ground,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
out of a vain hope to secure it by that means against time and
earthquakes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">These</span> are the most remarkable curiosities either of Turkish,
Christian, or Heathen antiquity, which in the space of this afternoon
we observed at <i>Ephesus</i>. Besides which we viewed many
intire pillars of an aqueduct, that passes over the plain from the
southern hills; as also in two places the uncertain footsteps of a
theatre; and without the new castle a full face<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>, with two serpents
(cut on a stone) whose heads meet over it, and their bodies
descend on each side. This monument is supposed to represent
<i>Diana</i>, in the two characters of <i>Luna</i> and <i>Proserpine</i>. But it is to be
wished, that some curious traveler might remain two or three days
at <i>Ephesus</i>; during which time by removing the weeds, and clearing
the confused ruins, he might possibly discover many valuable
inscriptions; as by the benefit of a ladder he might take one or
two from the wall above mentioned under the Christian ruins,
which to our great dissatisfaction we found not legible from the
ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Among</span> the few imperfect inscriptions discoverable in so short
a stay, the name of P. VEDIVS ABOSCANTVS, with
mention of his wife and daughter, is once or twice repeated both
in Greek and Latin. And ΑΤΤΙΚΟΝ ΗΡΩΔΗΝ, or the name of
that ingenious Roman, whose part is so entertaining in the <i>Noctes
Atticae</i> of <i>Gellius</i>, is preserved on a fragment among the pillars
of the aqueduct. In the same place is frequent mention of
<i>M. Antoninus</i>, once particularly on occasion of an honour done
by the city to his daughter <i>Fadilla</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> ii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> was a rainy and tempestuous morning, when, as we lay yet a
sleep in the public <i>kane</i>, a terrible clap of thunder discharged itself
seemingly in the very room. The vehemence of the noise
awakened us in great astonishment; and our eyes were no sooner
opened, but the whole place seemed to be filled with a red blaze
of fire. Each person was first solicitous for the safety of his companions,
and afterwards for that of the horses, which were dispersed
in their stations about the door. But finding that we had
received no detriment, either in our goods or persons, we blessed
God for our deliverance; and concluded by an infallible argument,
that the displosion must needs be extremely near us, in that the
light continued for some time after the sound.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> mount by six a clock, and now determine our return to
<i>Smyrna</i>; to which there lies a straight tho difficult and craggy
road, over the top of the <i>Alymán</i>; upon which account we thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
it preferable to take the way of the plains. This first led us over
the bridge of the <i>Caýster</i>, and then quickly after round the abrupt
precipice of the <i>Alymán</i>, and that old castle upon its edge,
which we had before so much in view, as we rode from <i>Tyria</i>.
From hence we pass thro a variety of low woods and pastures,
which in themselves were pleasant and diverting; tho the fountains
being all dry about this quarter, we were much distressed for
want of water. About four hours and a quarter from <i>Ephesus</i>
we descry on our left hand, on the rising of the hill, the deplorable
remainder of the castle of <i>Metropolis</i>; and at the foot thereof
such apparent traces of foundations, with variety of hewn marble,
as permitted us no longer to doubt concerning the place of that
waste city. And it may be added, that computing our way by
hours, as <i>Strabo</i> does by furlongs<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>, we did not greatly differ from
his account, who places it at little more than a third part of
the distance betwixt <i>Ephesus</i> and <i>Smyrna</i>. Not far from hence
we begin to approach a small, tho not shallow river, runing on
our right hand, which probably is the <i>Phyrites</i> of <i>Pliny</i><a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> mingling,
as he describes it, with the <i>Caýster</i>, not far from the <i>Stagnum
Pegasaeum</i>, or that lake, which we before observed in our
way from <i>Tyria</i> to <i>Ephesus</i>. Beyond this river we saw a large
extended pasture, overspread with the flocks, herds, and tents
of <i>Turcmen</i>. They had here pitched their station to the number of
fourteen hundred; for as we staid to taste their milk, and to view
their habitations, they themselves gave us this account, reckoning
about two hundred tents, and seven persons more or less appertaining
to each. As the whole race of the Turks were nothing
else but a numerous colony, that swarmed from <i>Scythia</i>; so these
<i>Turcmen</i> seem to be the peculiar descendants of the <i>Nomades
Scythae</i>, or <i>Shepherd Scythians</i>, and like them make it their employment
to breed and nurture cattle. To this end they never
assemble in towns, or betake themselves to houses; but flit from
place to place, as the season of the year directs, and seize without
control the vast neglected pastures of this desert empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> two hours and three quarters from <i>Metropolis</i> we arrive at
<i>Trianta</i>, a small but pleasant village, seated on a dry soil, and
enjoying a very healthful air; where we proposed to <i>conáck</i> this
evening. An <i>agá</i> here hospitably accommodated us with the convenience
of his country house, and likewise treated us with a
small collation after the Turkish fashion.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> iii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> seven a clock we leave <i>Trianta</i>, crossing a little river within
the limits of the village, and at an hour’s distance another of the
same bigness; one or both of which, as they unite in the bottom
of the plain, must be the antient <i>Halésus</i>, that ran into the sea at
<i>Colophon</i>. We continue in a large and beaten road, leaving <i>Giamóbashy</i>
on our left hand, till having <i>Sedícui</i> now in view, we
cross over a watry bottom to shorten our way thither. Here we
arrive about ten a clock, and stop to refresh ourselves in the consul’s
country house; where after a long disuse of chairs, which
are not the fashion of the Turks, we once more had the pleasure
of sitting down to diner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Having</span> mounted soon after three, the worshipful consul Raye,
with several gentlemen of our nation, did us the honour to meet
us about two miles distance from the village. On these therefore
we waited home the remainder of our way, and so returned before
six a clock in good health to <i>Smyrna</i>; having been much
obliged to Mr. Whalley for his care and conduct, as well as mutually
to one another for that chearful and unanimous temper,
which sweetened all our travels, and deceived the several fatigues
of this laborious journey.</p>

</div>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">March</span> xxvi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day I took my passage for <i>Constantinople</i> on board
the <i>King William</i> galley, captain Nehemiah Winter commander,
and accordingly went on board at six a clock in the
evening; being favoured with the company of Mr. Dunster, Mr.
Turner, and Mr. Clotterbooke, who after a short repast returned
a shore. On the same ship imbarked for <i>Constantinople</i> the <i>barút
agá</i> of <i>Smyrna</i>, with his <i>harém</i>, and a numerous family.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">March</span> xxvii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> set sail this morning with a gentle gale, which served us
as far as <i>St. George’s</i> island, that lies before the harbour of <i>Fochia
Vecchia</i>, that is <i>Phocaea</i>; betwixt which and the sand head, occasioned
by the discharge of the river <i>Hermus</i>, we came to an
anchor at the approach of the evening.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">March</span> xxviii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> set sail early this morning with little or no wind, the
whole day continuing calm till towards the evening; when the
gale began to grow fresh, and favouring us all night advanced
us betwixt the main land of <i>Aeolia</i> and the island of <i>Mitylene</i>,
or <i>Lesbos</i>, leaving the bay of <i>Cuma</i>, now called <i>Sotaléa</i>, upon our
right hand.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">March</span> xxix.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> morning with a contrary and very gentle gale we turn
betwixt the island and the main, having a fair view of the harbour,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
city, and castle of <i>Mitylene</i><a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>; the last of which seems to be
large and well walled, declining with a moderate descent on the
side of a gentle hill. The same coast of the island is stored
with many pleasant and considerable villages, well furnished with
arable and pasture ground, and large woods at a distance, said to
abound with deer. This day we advanced no farther than the isles
of <i>Musconisia</i>, formerly <i>Arginusae</i><a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>, situated betwixt the continent
of <i>Aeolia</i> and the island of <i>Mitylene</i>. Here therefore we
came to anchor about midday, lying opposite to the mouth of
the <i>Idaean</i> or <i>Adramyttian</i> gulph, made by the two promontories
of <i>Cana</i> on one side, and <i>Lecton</i> on the other, and fenced towards
the continent of <i>Troas</i> (for so that whole region may be called)
with the snowy and aspiring top of mount <i>Ida</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">March</span> xxx.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> morning the wind springing fair about four a clock, we
advance betwixt the island of <i>Mitylene</i> and the main of <i>Aeolia</i>,
the narrowed <i>bogáz</i> is made by cape <i>Siguri</i>, antiently <i>Sigrium</i>,
on the island side, and cape <i>Babá</i>, formerly <i>Lecton</i>, on that of
the main. Near midday we begin to turn this latter cape, and
thereby to gain the sight of <i>Imbros</i> and <i>Tenedos</i>; <i>Lemnos</i> not discovering
itself till some hours afterwards, as we advanced with
calm weather betwixt <i>Tenedos</i> and the <i>Trojan</i> shore; when the
low land of <i>Lemnos</i>, with the round and exalted top of <i>Athos</i> on
the other side of it, gave us a delightful prospect.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">March</span> xxxi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day turning to windward, we advance by nine a clock
between the town of <i>Tenedos</i> and the <i>Trojan</i> shore, the narrow
distance of about six or seven miles allowing us a distinct prospect
of each. <i>Tenedos</i> is a middle sized compact town, fortified with
a castle, seated immediately on the shore, and fenced toward the
land with a round hill; but exposed to the sea without the advantage
of any deep gulph, or commodious harbour. The whole
island is green and level, and has the appearance, as well as reputation,
of a rich and fertile soil. The wind not favouring us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
from hence, we proceed slowly the whole day with calm and
serene weather; and turning betwixt <i>Tenedos</i> and the <i>Phrygian</i>
continent, after enjoying the delightful sight of the <i>Trojan</i> campain
on one side, and of <i>Tenedos</i>, <i>Imbros</i>, and <i>Samothracia</i> on
the other, we anchored about six in the evening under the celebrated
promontory of <i>Sigéum</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> i.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Early</span> in the morning we endeavour to make sail from <i>Sigéum</i>,
but being taken in a dead calm, we were employed the
whole day in warping, that so passing the mouth of the <i>Hellespont</i>
we might lie (if occasion should so require) sheltered by the new
castle, and the point on which it stands. Having with great
fatigue made two or three warps, the wind at length favoured
us so far, as to advance us two leagues within the said new castle of
<i>Natolia</i>, when the captain thought it better to anchor, than to
proceed in so narrow a chanel and so dark a night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">At</span> this place it will be most proper to set down my thoughts
of <i>Troy</i>, and the whole <i>Trojan</i> shore, which for the space of
three days I viewed at a convenient distance in calm and serene
weather from the poop of the ship, feeding my eyes and mind
with an eager and boundless curiosity. That, which in a large
sense was called of old by <i>Strabo</i>, as at present by the modern
Greeks, the campain of <i>Troas</i>, begins at the promontory of <i>Lecton</i>,
and then fronting the isle of <i>Tenedos</i> ends in a delicious green and
level country, as far as the strait of the <i>Hellespont</i>. But from
the begining of this strait we sail by the main of that, which is
properly to be called the campain of <i>Troy</i>. And because our
modern travelers give a wild and indistinct account of this famous
place, I shall endeavour to describe the bounds, and situation
of it, in as clear and distinct terms as possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">From</span> cape <i>Sigéum</i> (whence antiently was computed the entrance
of the <i>Hellespont</i>) you sail about five miles, till you come
opposite to the mouth of the <i>Scamander</i>; and from thence about
two miles farther to a small prominence of land, by the antients
called <i>Rhoetéum</i>. Betwixt this <i>Rhoetéum</i> and <i>Sigéum</i>, the marine,
which bent in an even uninterrupted semicircle, afforded a commodious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
station for the Grecian fleet<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. But as <i>Strabo</i> well observes,
that in his time the <i>Scamander</i> began to interrupt this station, by
the sand it discharges on the shore; so it has since gained more
considerably on the sea, and formed that whole tongue of land,
on which is now built the new castle of <i>Natolia</i>. However in
the days of <i>Priam</i> the shore was undoubtedly more regular, as
well as more retired. And opposite thereto in the adjoining continent,
at such a distance as would admit the engagements, the
flights, the pursuits, and the encampments of each army (as they
are all described by <i>Homer</i>) we are to conceive of the walls and
buildings of antient <i>Troy</i>. But still we must be cautious of pointing
out, and distinguishing the very place; since in the reign of
<i>Tiberius Caesar</i> we are assured by <i>Strabo</i>, that there remained not
the least footstep of antient <i>Troy</i> to satisfy the curiosity of the
most searching traveler<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>. So vain are the accounts of our modern
<i>journalists</i>, who pretend to have seen the walls, the gates, or
other ruins of <i>Troy</i>; that, which now remains, being nothing but
the rubbish of new <i>Ilium</i>, or of that city once attempted there by
<i>Constantine</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> ii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> endeavour this morning to continue our voyage, but make
no considerable progress; because the gentle gale, that favoured
us, could not prevail against the current of the <i>Hellespont</i>, which
perpetually flows with a full and rapid course into the <i>Aegéan</i> sea.
We therefore drive back, and content ourselves with coming to
an anchor in the same place, from whence we weighed this morning;
taking the opportunity of going to dine on the Asian shore.
After midday a fresher wind advanced us within a small distance
from the old castles; where it again deserted us, and obliged us
to drop anchor a second time, to maintain the way we had gained
in opposition to the violent stream of this chanel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> iii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> continue anchored at the same place, being all this day
entirely becalmed. And the day following, the calm having
changed into a contrary wind detained us still at the same anchor.
But however disagreeable this interruption in the course of our
voyage might prove to some others of the company, the leisure of
those two days was to me very grateful. Nor could I esteem it any
loss of time, but rather an advantage, on account of the favourable
and unexpected opportunity it afforded me of visiting two so
famous castles, together with the villages adjoining to them<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>.
Going ashore therefore in the captain’s pinnace to the town on
the Asian side (formerly called <i>Abýdos</i><a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>, but by the Turks <i>Eskí
Natolia Hisar</i>) with great pleasure I walked about the place, but
found no footsteps of antiquity<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>. The town is large, but mean;
yet famous for a curious sort of earthen ware finely glazed, which
is made here, and vended in great quantities. The castle is intire,
of a square figure, with bastions projecting at each corner,
and with one side flanks the water on a level shore; where are
to be seen betwixt twenty and thirty vast guns, such as perhaps
are no where else to be found, except in some other parts of
Turkey. They are of brass, and have a bore at least three quarters
of a yard diameter; and are charged with stone bullets of
the same dimensions, which lie at hand spherically cut. The
charge of powder, as I was informed on the place by the <i>barút
agá</i> of <i>Smyrna</i>, is an hundred and five <i>okes</i>. From <i>Abýdos</i> I
crossed over in a small wherry to <i>Sestos</i><a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>, that is, from <i>Natolia</i> to
<i>Rumeli Hisar</i>, and in the way observed the art of the boatman in
avoiding the force of the current, a circumstance mentioned by
<i>Strabo</i><a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. This town stands on a precipice, descending steeply towards
the sea shore; and is better built, tho less, than <i>Abýdos</i>.
It has a castle consisting of a triangular tower, enclosed within<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
an high wall of this <img src="images/trefoil.jpg" width="15" height="15" alt="" /> figure, and that again with another triangular
wall, all surrounded with a deep foss. In the same level
with the water are mounted about thirty guns, of the same or
rather bigger size than those of <i>Natolia Hisar</i>; and by each lie
great heaps of stones, cut spherically to the dimensions of each
canon. In relation to this town of <i>Sestos</i>, and the tower of <i>Leander</i>,
once adjoining to the shore a little above the town, I remembered
that request of <i>Musaeus</i>:</p>

side is delightful to the traveler, as well as fertile to the inhabitants;
being for the most part of a level situation, and in the
neighbourhood of the villages it possesses, well cultivated and distinguished
into pastures. About three leagues from <i>Maitos</i> we
view on the same shore two pleasant and well situated villages,
by the name of the <i>Lesser</i> and <i>Greater Galata</i>. Thence about the
distance of two leagues we arrive betwixt <i>Lampsacus</i> on the Asian,
and <i>Callipolis</i> on the European shore; the former a small town,
and the latter a city of no inconsiderable extent; so that now
they have changed their fortune, and that character, which they
bore in the time of <i>Strabo</i><a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>. About twelve leagues from <i>Callipolis</i>
lies the island <i>Marmora</i>, exceeding high ground, abounding with
rich veins of durable and pretious marble; the same of which
has given it the name of <i>Marmora</i>, instead of the ancient <i>Proconésus</i>.
Adjoining to this are two lesser isles, <i>Kutali</i> and <i>Alonia</i>,
the latter eminent for the product of excellent wines. Betwixt
these islands and the beautiful Thracian shore, which here graces
the <i>Propontis</i>, we were advanced by a brisk and favourable gale<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
at the approach of the evening, and from thence are now continuing
our voyage, with the same auspicious wind, and hopes,
if God permit, to arrive at <i>Constantinople</i> early by to morrow
morning.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> vi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Before</span> ten last evening the wind having changed to our disadvantage,
we find ourselves this morning but little advanced
from <i>Marmora</i>; however by the benefit of turning to windward,
we proceeded this day about the distance of ten leagues. Every
other tack brought us near to the Thracian shore, and entertained
us with a fair view of the most green and fertile campain I ever
yet beheld. By the same means we enjoyed the opportunity of seeing
the famous port and city of <i>Heracléa</i>, built behind a small
eminence, which protends itself into the sea, and forms an
haven on each side of the city. Not far from hence stands on
the same shore the fair town of <i>Selymbria</i>; near which the night
now overtakes us, and deprives us of that delicious prospect, which
the whole day afforded us, of the feilds of Thrace. It was on this
day, that captain Winter wanting his log line to be brought him
from a chest in the great cabin, was not permitted by the <i>barút agá</i>
to send any person down for it, by reason of his <i>harém</i> being there.
At length he yeilded to let the captain’s son go, a child of about
eight years of age.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> vii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Early</span> this morning I betake myself to the enjoyment of the
same diverting prospect, whilst the ship, by the benefit of tacking,
passes by <i>Grande</i> and <i>Piccolo Ponte</i>; and so betwixt nine and ten
of the clock comes to an anchor within a short league of the <i>Seven
Towers</i>, a castle which forms the extreme point of <i>Constantinople</i>.
Here we continued wind bound the remainder of this day, because
the narrowness of the chanel, into which we were now to
enter; and the force of the current, which runs very rapidly out
of the Thracian <i>Bosphorus</i>; did not suffer us to advance against
the violent north wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> viii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> morning about nine a clock the wind, which changed
nothing of its point, yet abated so much of its strength, that it
permitted us to turn from the <i>Seven Towers</i> along the bending
walls of <i>Constantinople</i>, as far as the <i>Seraglio point</i>. But the violence
of the current prohibiting us to make the harbour of <i>Galata</i>,
the ship was again obliged to drop anchor, and wait till she
could either make sail with a fair wind, or take the opportunity
of a calm to be towed in by <i>hamáls</i>. We had not long cast
anchor, when my esteemed freind, Mr. Matthias Goodfellow, was
pleased to visit me on board the ship; and carrying me ashore in
the boat, which brought him, first introduced me to his excellency,
the Lord Paget, and then kindly allotted me a pleasant and convenient
apartment in his house at <i>Galata</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xiii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day I attended the funeral of Signior <i>Demetrasco</i>, chief
<i>dragoman</i> to the English ambassador, who tho by faith a Latin,
yet by birth was of the Greek nation. And accordingly in the way
of burying proper to this latter, I observed the manner of carrying
the corps of the deceased barefaced, clothed in his late usual habit,
and supported by four of his nearest relations; who were
followed by women slaves, hired to make a hideous pomp, by
tearing their hair, extorting forced and counterfeit tears, and repeating
in a continual loud and frightful lamentation, ὦ ἀφέντη μου;
that is, <i>O my master!</i></p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">I paid</span> a visit to Signior <i>Rombarts</i>, a gentile and ingenious
merchant of the Dutch nation, at his house in <i>Curuchesmée</i>, a
village on the Thracian <i>Bosphorus</i>. Here I observed a <i>sophá</i> room
remarkably adorned after the richest Turkish fashion, the roof
formed into a cupola, and the gilding and painting of the whole
so splendidly curious, that it amounted at first to the sum of four
thousand <i>hungárs</i>, or two thousand pounds sterling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xvii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">I took</span> the opportunity of passing over the chanel to <i>Constantinople</i>,
in company of Signior <i>Wright</i>, the Dutch minister of
this place, with whom I visited the <i>mint</i>; the <i>Grand Signior’s</i>
lions; and the <i>mosques</i> of <i>Sultan Solymán</i>, <i>Sultan Bajazet</i>, <i>Sultan
Achmét</i>, and the <i>Validée</i>. That of <i>Bajazet</i> and the <i>Validée</i>
are adorned only with two <i>minarées</i>, that of <i>Solymán</i> with four,
and that of <i>Achmét</i> with six. They all much resemble one another,
both in the inward and outward figure. They first consist
of a spatious court, enriched all round with fair and regular
cloisters formed by pillars, some of whose shafts are carved with
white marble, some with serpentine stone, and some with porphyry;
but all the capitals are of the modern Turkish figure.
Next is the body of the <i>mosque</i>, covered outwardly with domes,
and supported inwardly with four massy pillars, from the tops of
which rises a regular cupola, forming the roof of the whole <i>mosque</i>.
Whoever exactly compares the beauty and grandeur of these several
<i>mosques</i>, will find that of <i>Solymán</i> more regular, and artificial
in the outward frame; that of <i>Achmét</i> more magnificent in the
whole, and on the outside more beautiful in the work of the pillars;
that of the <i>Validée</i>, tho less in bulk and extent than the
other two, yet more curious in the inward ornaments and workmanship
than either; and that of <i>Bajazet</i>, which is the oldest,
inferior to the rest both in bulk and beauty, except that some
cast pillars, which form the cloisters of the court, consist of a
more polite, shining, and pretious stone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> same morning I visited the antient cirque of this city, a
large oblong space flanked on three sides with the houses of the
city, and on the fourth with the walls of the <i>mosque</i> of <i>Sultan
Achmét</i>. Therein stand three pillars, the first of square stone,
formerly covered with gilded brass, at the end of the cirque, and
supposed to have been the goal of the <i>stadium</i>. It now declines
much, having suffered greatly by time, and openings in the several
joints of the stones. The second pillar is of wreathed brass,
not above twelve feet high, lately terminated at the top with figures
of three serpents rising from the pillar, and with their necks
and heads forming a beautiful triangle. But this monument was
rudely broken from the top of the pillar by some attendants of the
late Polish ambassador, whose lodgings were appointed in this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
cirque, opposite to the said pillar<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>. The third pillar is a long
square stone, or obelisk, decreasing gradually from its basis, till
it ends almost in a point. The matter is granate, or Theban marble;
and each side is engraven with birds, beasts, and other hieroglyphical
figures<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>. This had once lain upon the ground, and, as
we may conceive from the inscriptions, a considerable time; till
<i>Theodosius</i> erected it on a large and square basis, adorned on each
side with various images; and having fixt on the top of this basis
four brass supporters, on these he set the aforesaid hieroglyphical
Theban column. There is a Latin inscription on one side of the
basis, and a Greek one on the other, importing what I here mention
concerning the erection of the pillar. The Greek runs thus:</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day having first visited Mr. <i>Schrever</i> (then ill of the plague,
of which he died two days after) in a small boat of the countrey,
in company with Mr. Goodfellow and Mr. Evans, I made a tour
up the Thracian <i>Bosphorus</i>. This chanel we may conceive to begin
from the point of <i>Scutari</i> on one side, and that of <i>Tophana</i>
on the other; from whence in a winding figure, graced on each
side with <i>seraglios</i> of the chief courtiers of this empire, and on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
the marine with almost continued villages, as also two castles in
the narrowest part, it extends about eighteen or twenty miles, as
far as the antient rocky isles of the <i>Symplegades</i>, which seem to
open and shut, as one advances to them in the <i>Bosphorus</i><a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>. The
largest of them is situated on the European shore, and till lately
bore an antient Corinthian pillar, to which a vulgar error has given
the name of <i>Pompey’s column</i>. It was erected not on a regular basis
of its own, but upon an antient heathen altar, that now only remains;
the shaft and capital of the pillar, which have lately fallen,
being yet visible in four pieces among the cliffs of the rock. On
the aforesaid remaining altar may be read this inscription in large
Roman letters.</p>

miles from hence, in returning thro the chanel, we go ashore on
the European side to visit a famous convent of Greek priests, by
the name of <i>Mauromolos</i>, seated in the cliff of an hill, and enjoying
a beautiful church, adorned with many rich pieces of religious
furniture; as books bound in covers of massy silver; an ἁγία πύλη,
or <i>sacred curtain</i><a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>, wrought both richly and artfully in silk and
golden figures; and a set of painting not of the vulgar sort, but
regular and proportionable, the most curious of which was done
in Muscovy. These fathers are exempted from their <i>harách</i>, on
account of a present of excellent fair cherries, once presented to
the <i>Grand Signior</i>. Over a fountain, that serves the convent
with water, they have this device, not more proper for the place,
than ingenious for the contrivance, in making the same words read

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xxvi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day I crossed the water from <i>Galata</i> to visit the antient
<i>Chalcédon</i>, where I saw the poor Greek church dedicated to <i>St.
Euphemia</i><a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>; and a little distant from the present village, the place
where was held the fourth general council. Returning we row
under the shore, to see the <i>Grand Signior’s</i> beautiful <i>seraglio</i> near
<i>Scutari</i>. When <i>Chalcédon</i> was an eminent city, which is now reduced
to a slender village; <i>Scutari</i>, which by a contrary event is
at present a fair and spatious city, was a poor and ignoble village,
tho it then had the name of <i>Chrysopolis</i>, as we find by <i>Zosimus</i><a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xxviii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">I retired</span> to <i>Belgrade</i>, a small Greek village, seated about
twelve miles from <i>Constantinople</i>, and about five from the <i>Euxine</i>
sea; where the English ambassador has a countrey seat. It is pleasantly
situated among large woods of oak, beech, chesnut, and
other trees, and enjoys an healthy air and water. Here I took the
opportunity of riding to visit the famous aqueducts of <i>Constantinople</i>,
distant from this village about six miles, which were built
by <i>Valentinian</i> the first<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>, <i>accurante Clearcho praefecto</i>, as <i>Cassiodorus</i>
says<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>; and afterwards repaired by <i>Solymán</i> the <i>Magnificent</i>,
who exempted twelve adjacent Greek villages from the customary
tribute of this empire, for the care he enjoined them of keeping
these aqueducts in repair. The most remarkable of them are three
great and lofty fabrics, built over so many valleys betwixt the adjoining
hills, of which the longest has many but less arches, and
may possibly be the entire work of <i>Solymán</i>. The other two have
the appearance of a more antient and regular architecture, consisting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
of two rows of arches one over the other; and those of the
second row enclosed by pillars cut thro the middle, so as to render
the fabric both passable like a bridge, and useful for the conveyance
of water. The more considerable of these two consists
only of four large arches, each twenty yards long, and something
above twenty high, supported by octangular pillars of about fifty
six yards in circumference towards the bottom. The village of
<i>Belgrade</i> is likewise honoured with two royal <i>kiosks</i>, the one of the
<i>Grand Signior</i>, the other of the <i>Validée</i>; each situated in two delightful
recesses of the neighbouring wood, and adorned with natural
avenues thro lofty groves of beech, oak, and chesnut. At
each of these <i>kiosks</i> the waters of the public aqueduct are gathered
into fair and ample cisterns of hewn stone, from whence they pass
in arched chanels under ground to the royal city.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> vii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">After</span> a pleasant retirement of ten days at <i>Belgrade</i> I returned
to my lodgings at <i>Galata</i>, to take the opportunity of seeing the
remaining curiosities of <i>Constantinople</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> viii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">I walked</span> almost thro the extent of the whole city to visit the
famous pillar of <i>Arcadius</i>, a lofty and aspiring fabric, of the Doric
order, built with a wonderful regularity and exactness of architecture,
bearing on the basis, and on the whole shaft from top to
bottom, various warlike figures of men in arms, chariots, galleys,
and other ornaments, which in a spiral manner encircle the whole
pillar; every figure being so well proportioned to the distance,
from whence it is seen, that those at the top, the middle, and the
bottom, appear to the eye exactly of the same size. Returning
from this pillar I passed by the old pillar of <i>Aurátbasar</i>, defaced
by the several conflagrations of the city, and bound in several
places with rings of iron by the care and charge of the emperor
<i>Manuel</i>, as is witnessed by this inscription on the top.</p>

<p class="noindent">From this pillar I was desirous of passing thro <i>Atmeidan</i>, that is
the <i>hippodromus</i>, or <i>cirque</i> above mentioned, to review the <i>mosque</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
of <i>Sultan Achmét</i>, and make a stricter observation on the three
pillars there erected. Here I was informed, that the brass serpentine
pillar was erected by the emperor <i>Leo</i>, as a charm against the
noisom number of serpents, which in his time infested the city;
the same person superstitiously affirming, that since the late defacement
of this pillar, by the breaking of the serpents heads, the
city was again molested by innumerable noxious serpents. At the
foot of the old pillar, formerly covered with brass, I read the remains
of that inscription once taken by Sir <i>George Sandys</i>, but
since his time part of it buried with earth, and part broken away;
which is very erroneously printed in his <i>Travels</i><a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>. On the basis of
the hieroglyphical pillar I observed the carved representation of
the pillar it self, together with the figures of men labouring to
erect it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> ix.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> the interest of a Greek, who serves the <i>bostangí bashá</i> as his
surgeon, I was admitted in company of Mr. John Philips, an
eminent merchant, into the great <i>seraglio</i> of <i>Constantinople</i>, where
we passed thro two courts, that form the entry of the palace;
the first of which has a small arsenal, furnished with arms and
ammunition; the second has piazzas on two sides, in which the
<i>janisaries</i> are wont to eat, and opens at the upper end into the
<i>diván</i>. From these two courts we were permitted to walk round
the full extent of the garden, on each side of the palace. They
are rude and wild places, affording nothing that is entertaining,
but that wherewith nature has furnished them, which is an admirable
situation rising into convenient ascents, and capable of infinite
improvement, if it were happily in the possession of a Christian
prince. The whole plat of ground, which they call the gardens
of the <i>seraglio</i>, is covered with cypress and other trees, thro which
are cut shady walks, where <i>kiosks</i> are seen of various sorts; the
most eminent and remarkable of which is that called the <i>Blew kiosk</i>,
fronting the town of <i>Scutari</i>. This and the other called the <i>Alaí
kiosk</i>, fronting the city of <i>Galata</i>, are rich and splendid pleasure
houses, covered with a gilded cupola, and adorned in their several
walls with Indian tiles, and stately chimneypieces of solid
brass. Passing thro the extent of the <i>seraglio</i> towards the extreme
point, that looks up the Thracian <i>Bosphorus</i>, you observe a Corinthian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
pillar consisting of white marble, of which the ignorant
Turks report a fabulous and ridiculous account; but its true original
is discovered by this inscription on one plane of the basis:</p>

<div class="inscription-container">
<div class="inscription">
<div class="line-j">FORTVNAE REDVCI OB</div>
<div class="line-l">DEVICTOS GOTHOS<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></div>

<p class="noindent">On the opposite plane is likewise this religious device:</p>

    <td>ΧϹ</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ΝΙ</td>
    <td>ΚΑ</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">Near this pillar we were admitted thro a gate, which opens into
a green court, and that again into a garden kept in somewhat a
regular order. From hence we ascend by a few steps into an
apartment of the <i>Grand Signior</i>, where are two rich <i>kiosks</i>, a fish
pond, a paved walk, and an open gallery. Here we were shewn
the lodgings, where the unhappy princes of the empire are detained
prisoners, as also the dark chambers of the <i>ichoglans</i>, and
the door that leads into the <i>harém</i> of the <i>Grand Signior</i>. There
also are shewn two or three instances of the strength and the activity
of <i>Sultan Morát</i>; as a ponderous round stone, which with one
finger he is said to have lifted by a ring fixt therein; likewise five
thick and substantial sheilds, which being placed upon one another
were peirced thro by a cast of his <i>jiríd</i> still sticking in them; also
several silver pellets thrown by him with that violence, as to
stick in an iron door. The above mentioned gallery is rich and
splendid, adorned with various gilding of flower work, and supported
with beautiful serpentine pillars. In the sides of one of
the <i>kiosks</i> are three orbicular stones of fine porphyry, the middlemost
of which is curiously polished, and thereby serves to reflect
the prospect of the <i>seraglio</i> and adjoining city, in the nature of a
looking glass. At the further end of the garden of the <i>seraglio</i> are
the intire walls of an antient Christian church, and near to that the
aviary of the <i>Grand Signior</i>, where I observed the hens of <i>Grand
Cairo</i>, having blue gills and feathers curiously coloured with grey
circles, and in the center of each a spot of black.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day I retired again to <i>Belgrade</i>, for the advantage of its
healthy air and water, and the entertainment of its shady situation.
Hence on the twelfth instant I made a tour towards <i>Domuzderé</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
and the shore of the <i>Black Sea</i>, on which we rode for some
space of ground, and returned by that called <i>Ovid’s Tower</i>, thro
a fertile tract of ground, curiously varied with corn, grass, and
shady woods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">I returned</span> again to my lodgings at <i>Galata</i>, and the next
day crossed the water in company with Mr. Goodfellow to <i>Constantinople</i>,
where after a visit to the <i>mosque</i> of <i>Solymán</i> the <i>Magnificent</i>,
we obtained leave to ascend one of the <i>minarées</i>, from
which the <i>muezins</i> call the Turks to their <i>namáz</i>, being about an
hundred and twenty feet high. Here we took a delightful prospect
of the whole situation and extent of <i>Stambol</i>, as likewise of
<i>Galata</i>, <i>Pera</i>, and <i>Scutari</i>, with the neighbouring seas, canals,
and land that encloses them. But the peculiar happiness of this
day was the employment of about two hours, which we leisurely
spent in viewing the stupendous church of <i>Sophía</i><a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>, now profaned
by its conversion into a Turkish <i>mosque</i>. It chiefly merits the regard
of any curious traveler for the reliques of its rich mosaic
work; the variety of pretious marble<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>, which adorns it, consisting
of serpentine, alabaster, and porphyry; and the architecture
of its large and flat tho sublime cupola<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>, in which are still the
entire figures of <i>Christ</i> and the twelve <i>Apostles</i>, and in the windows
many inscriptions in mosaic work from the <i>New Testament</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">I made</span> a visit by boat to the <i>Seven Towers</i>, now a prison for
persons of quality, since by the fate of war it has fallen into the
hands of the Turks, but antiently the <i>Porta Janicula</i> of <i>Constantinople</i>.
The beautiful remains of this gate are still admirable, tho
by the Turks suffered to be almost concealed by a dead wall, and
the shade of the neighbouring trees. It is a regular and carved
arch of white marble, supported by two beautiful pillars, adorned
in the pilasters with a sculpture representing several military affairs,
and flanked on each side the pillars with twelve tablets of
carved work extremely well performed, which contain several
poetical stories. Among the rest is <i>Hercules</i> and the <i>Nemeaean
lion</i>, the beast prodigious and terrible, but confessing its conqueror
by an agreable posture; <i>Luna</i> and <i>Endymion</i>; a winged
<i>Pegasus</i>, managed by some of the <i>Muses</i>; a pourtraiture of
the known combat of whirlbats; and an imperial figure, crowned
by two celestial machines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Returning</span> by boat along the walls of the city, I observed its
crooked figure and posture to the sea; and noted also the several
square towers variously interspersed at unequal distances, each
bearing an inscription much to the same purport, as may be seen
by the following copy, which I took of them in the boat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">About</span> midday I saw the ceremonies of the <i>dervíse</i> convent of
the order called <i>Meuleví</i> at <i>Pera</i>, consisting of their <i>namáz</i>, somewhat
longer than is ordinary at other times and places. After
which followed a sermon, that is, a gallimaufry of dreams and
nonsense, pronounced by the prior of the convent, as he sat cross-leg’d
on the seat of a two elbowed wooden chair. This was succeeded
by their music in a gallery over the door; during which
about fourteen <i>dervíses</i> led up a religious dance in the area of their
theatre (for such is the figure and contrivance of it) in which they
turn round almost in the same place with incredible swiftness,
without either weariness or giddiness, for the space of half an
hour. By this exercise their brain is so habitually fortified against
dizziness, that one of them was able to hand upon the half moon
of a <i>minarée</i> belonging to the <i>Solymanjá</i>, and from thence to
salute the <i>Grand Signior</i> at his palace of <i>Cushcui</i>, at the same time
firing off a pistol, and drinking a dish of coffee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">About</span> five this evening I took leave of Mr. Goodfellow, and
embarked upon a boat manned with seven hands, which I had
hired for ten dollars to transport my self, my horse, and two servants
from <i>Galata</i> to <i>Montagnia</i>, being the space of two leagues.
When having a fair wind, which by degrees increased, and exposed
me to the fatigue of a nauseous sea sickness, after midnight
I entered the two capes, which form the <i>Sinus Cianus</i>. In this
bay is that famous fountain mentioned by <i>Virgil</i>:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> xviii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> six this morning I landed safe at <i>Montagnia</i>, a small Turkish
town, which seems to have been the <i>Apaméa</i> of the antients;
<i>Cius</i>, or <i>Prusa ad Arganthonium</i>, being now a little village, that
lies farther towards the utmost corner of the bay. Here I hire a
guide and horse to carry my self, servants, and baggage to <i>Prusia</i>,
antiently <i>Prusa ad Olympum</i>, where by God’s blessing I arrive
safely about midday; and taking up my lodgings in the great
silk <i>kane</i>, I there determine to repose till to morrow morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Prusia</span> is a large and fair city, situate at the foot of <i>Olympus
Mysenus</i>, a mountain of exceeding hight, and covered with perpetual
snow; which from its bowels furnishes the adjacent city
with many large and plentiful fountains, and by the same means
gives nourishment to the beautiful and flourishing trees, which intermix
themselves with the houses of the place. These are chiefly
mulberries, which maintain the industrious worm, that produces
the white and lovely silk of <i>Prusia</i>; which I here saw spun from
caldrons of hot water, the several cods yeilding at once three
threads upon a wheel, turned by the person who tends the caldron.
Besides the several cold streams issuing from <i>Olympus</i>,
there flows from the same origin a plentiful sulphureous chanel,
which is collected into four hot natural baths much frequented,
and with marvelous success, as is here generally beleived. The
several fabrics of the baths are very stately, of which I shall describe
that, which is called the new one, for a specimen of the rest.
It consists first of a large oblong room paved with marble, enclosed
all round with free stone, and covered at the top with three noble
cupolas leaded on the outside. Round the inward walls of the
room are <i>sophás</i>, about a yard high, and two broad, sufficient
for the undressing of three hundred men. In the middle is a round
stone cistern, overflowing with cold water, which continually
washes the pavement, and serves for other uses of the bagnio.
From this room you enter into a second moderately warm, having
on the sides oblong troughs of hot water, and in the middle a
fountain of cold; the walls, roof, and pavement being all of
white polished marble. From hence you are led by the attendants
of the bagnio into a third apartment of an orbicular figure,
paved, roofed, and walled with richer marble, that is, of more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
curious veins and various colours. The pavement hereof is sunk
into a round cistern about six yards diameter, which is constantly
full of hot water to the depth of about six feet, and surrounded
with a stone bench for the ease of those, who care not to swim,
or walk about the cistern. As the water constantly runs from
thence by passages at the bottom of the cistern, so is it continually
supplied by three large chanels, which from as many sides of
the room yeild a plentiful stream of water, almost scalding at
the first touch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Besides</span> these baths there is not much remarkable in <i>Prusia</i>,
except what may be collected from the history of the place; as
that it has the ruins of a castle, built by one of the <i>Comneni</i>, as
appears from the following inscription:</p>

<div class="inscription-container">

<p class="noindent">It was made the first capital of the Turkish empire by <i>Osmán</i>, or
<i>Ottoman</i>, the founder of that monarchy. And it has the monument
not only of the said <i>Ottoman</i>, but likewise of his immediate
successors, <i>Orchán</i>, <i>Solymán</i>, <i>Amurát</i>, <i>Bagazet</i>, and <i>Mahomet</i> the
first.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> xxi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> morning about eleven a clock I set forward on my journey,
in company of a <i>caraván</i> bound to several parts on the road
to <i>Smyrna</i>. With these I now travel three hours, and then <i>conáck</i>
with them upon a convenient plat of grass, on the plains of
<i>Prusia</i>. In the midway we cross the river <i>Hippius</i> runing thro
these plains into the <i>Sinus Cianus</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> xxii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> travel this day to the left of the <i>Palus Artynia</i>, which being
fed from mount <i>Olympus</i>, extends itself the length of many
miles, and shews several little islands, in which are one or two
compact Greek towns. At length the lake vents itself by the
chanel of the river <i>Rhyndacus</i>, at which we arrive about six a
clock this evening, and passing it at a long wooden bridge, near<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
the ruins of another built of stone, we take up our <i>conáck</i> on the
opposite bank, in a village now called <i>Ulubat</i>, but antiently <i>Apollonia
ad Rhyndacum</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> xxiii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> ride eight hours, and then bait on the banks of a little
river, which runs towards those called the <i>Adrastian plains</i>. Three
hours farther, at the village of <i>Susegierlíck</i> we cross the fair large
and sandy chanel of the <i>Aesépus</i>, and proceeding still two hours
more we at length <i>conáck</i> upon the hills.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> xxiv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> this day pass a street called the <i>Irongate</i>, and in seven hours
arrive at the fair capacious <i>kane</i> of <i>Mandahóra</i>, where are seven
rude porphyry pillars thought to be of <i>Trojan</i> original. Here
we repose till towards evening, and then once more crossing the
<i>Aesépus</i>, which rising in <i>Ida</i> continues its course under the houses
of this village, we proceed about an hour, and then lodge in a
grassy plat about an hour to the left of <i>Balihísar</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> xxv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Rising</span> now a little after midnight we proceed seven hours,
and then resting in the woods till three in the afternoon, we
pass by the usual <i>conáck</i> of <i>Kurugelchíck</i>, and one hour and an
half from thence at length lodge in a pleasant green spot of ground
on the mountain <i>Temnus</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> xxvi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> four a clock we proceed, and having passed the <i>Temnus</i>,
by seven a clock we cross the chanel of the <i>Caicus</i>, which here is
but small, not being far distant from its fountain head. But an
hour farther at <i>Gelemba</i> we again observe it now much enlarged,
and runing by the <i>kane</i> and houses of that place, from whence it
bends its course on the left hand to <i>Pergamus</i>. At this <i>kane</i> we
repose half an hour, and afterwards in the plains two or three
hours more; but about midday we again remount, and in four
hours cross the <i>Hyllus</i>, at a strait betwixt two hills; in an hour
after which, in the midst of a fruitful and delicious plain, we arrive
at <i>Thyatira</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> xxvii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">I repose</span> this day at <i>Thyatira</i>, which by the Turks is now
called <i>Akhísar</i>. My design in staying here was to observe the
scattered remains of architecture, which are to be seen in many
places, together with some inscriptions. The most remarkable of
these is one published, but erroneously, by Sir <i>George Wheler</i><a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>;
which I copied from a stone coffin, on which it is cut.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">February</span> xvi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> travel still over the <i>Temnus</i>, and on our right hand discover
a large open vale on the top of the mountain, rich and well cultivated.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
In somewhat more than six hours we had passed the
<i>Temnus</i>, and enter into a rich plain extended all along the backside
of <i>Ida</i>, now <i>Cordág</i>; at the foot of which, about four miles distant
from the road we descry the agreable seat of <i>Balihísar</i>. From
this side of <i>Ida</i> thro a rich and fertile campain flows the river
<i>Aesépus</i>, now called <i>Simow</i> by the Turks, which we cross by an
old bridge at the village of <i>Mandahóra</i>, and there take our <i>conáck</i>
in a large and convenient <i>kane</i>; which is more to be noted
for its seven large pillars of course porphyry, now employed to
support the roof of this barbarous edifice, but might possibly once
stand in some fabric of antient <i>Troy</i>, from whence <i>Mandahóra</i>
is distant about ten hours.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">February</span> xvii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> eight a clock we set forward from <i>Mandahóra</i>, leaving the
<i>Aesépus</i> to surround those hills on our right hand, whilst we proceed
a shorter way, over small hills and dales, to meet it again in
six hours and a half at <i>Susegierlíck</i>, where we were entertained in
the public <i>kane</i> with excellent pike taken in that river.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">February</span> xviii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> begin to bend our course more directly towards the <i>Hellespont</i>,
and in order thereto proceed over a tract of gentle mountains,
which <i>Homer</i> calls πόδα νείατον Ἴδης<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>; now frequented with
wild beasts, but pleasant for the prospect they afford us on our
right hand, whilst we pursue with our eye the whole course of
the <i>Aesépus</i> almost as far as <i>Mihalíck</i>, where it enters the sea. In
three hours we pass by an old village and adjoining castle called
<i>Minyás</i>, which name it likewise lends to the neighbouring plain
and lake; the former of which I take to have been antiently called
the plains of <i>Zelia</i>, and the latter the λίμνη Δασκυλίτις<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. Not far from
hence flows a river by the modern name of <i>Mulvetelée</i>, passing
into the adjoining lake; after which are small hills and pleasant
villages, till in five hours we descend into the plains of <i>Zelia</i>,
which are pleasant, fertile, and well cultivated. Here we pass
thro large fields of wallnut trees, which bring us in five hours
and a half to the banks of a fair and broad river; which I
take to be the <i>Tarsius</i> of the antients, and by the Turks is now
vulgarly called <i>Tarza</i>. We were here obliged to ferry over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
with our horses three together in a boat, the stream being not
securely fordable. In one hour and half from thence, thro a
level and verdant campain to the left of the above mentioned lake,
we come to <i>Humumlée</i>, and there <i>conáck</i>. The lake we leisurely
viewed from our <i>conáck</i>, and could compute it to be about thirty
miles in circumference, being always full of water, and stored
with plenty of fish, among which it then furnished us with delicious
pikes. We were here informed, that the river, we lately
passed, empties it self into this lake, from whence by a new
chanel it takes its course to <i>Mihalíck</i>, where together with the
<i>Aesépus</i> it soon after falls into the sea. And directly beyond this
lake we then beheld the fair exalted hills of <i>Cyzicus</i>, and the
<i>Peninsula Cyzicena</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">February</span> xix.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> six this morning we leave <i>Humumlée</i>, where we had been
lodged not inconveniently in a farmer’s house, and riding thro
a continued campain begin to view the snowy head of <i>Ida</i>. But
in some time we again lose sight of it, and in five hours from our
setting out approach to <i>Bozacgée</i>, seated in the <i>Adrastian</i> plains<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>;
and at the same place to a large and fair river, by the Turks named
<i>Bocléw</i><a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>, which we leave on our left hand, till in two hours we
cross it by a dangerous wooden bridge near <i>Sorrícui</i><a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>, and there
<i>conáck</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">February</span> xx.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> six we leave <i>Sorrícui</i>, and proceed a little way, where a fair
is held at <i>St. Georgetide</i>, which continues for the space of ten days,
and is much frequented. We then mount a high and steep hill,
which bears a stately and extended wood of oak; the lower
shrubs of which produce a quantity of galls, and at the roots of
these the ground is overspread with an excellent and well scented
sage. On the top of this hill in three hours we have a near prospect
of the sea, and isle of <i>Marmora</i>, with one side of the <i>Peninsula</i>
of <i>Cyzicus</i>. By the fifth hour we begin to descend on the
other side into a pleasant and green plain, and by the seventh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
arrive at <i>Dimotico</i>, a market town, vulgarly so called from the
corruption, as I suppose, of the antient <i>Didymotichos</i>. At this
place occurs a moderate river with a wooden bridge; and an
hour beyond the town a large one with a fair bridge of stone,
built by the munificence of <i>Sultan Mahomet</i> the fourth. Here are
to be observed the marks of a royal way, denoted by two equal
and regular barrows on each side, by which lies the <i>Grand Signior’s</i>
road to the wars. Hitherto our way had all along surrounded
mount <i>Ida</i>, which often favoured us with the sight of its hoary
head, and many rivers flowing from its watry bowels. We had
now an hour farther to reach our <i>conáck</i> at <i>Pismetlée</i>; but losing
our way, we were conducted by a cowherd (who was cudgel’d into
this civility by <i>Mustaphá bey</i>) to a small pleasant village an hour
farther in our journey, where being obliged to force our reception,
we were thereupon lodged in the <i>mosque</i> of the place. This
will appear an instance very singular in Turkey, and was looked
upon as an abomination by the <i>imám</i> of the parish; who could not
enter that place of his worship on the following morning, without
saluting us three times with <i>Stifer Alláh</i>, that is, <i>God forbid</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">February</span> xxi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> an hard road betwixt barren hills we travel this day towards
<i>Jerdáck</i>, a village which is the <i>scale</i> for passing the <i>Hellespont</i>,
seated within half an hour of the antient <i>Lampsacus</i>. This road
led us within four hours to the shore of the <i>Propontis</i>, along
which we proceed four hours farther to our <i>conáck</i>, where the sea
contracts it self into that strait chanel, betwixt <i>Lampsacus</i> and
<i>Callipolis</i>. Here we find a large <i>kane</i>, in which are about twelve
antient marble pillars, each of one fair intire stone, some round,
others chanel’d, and of various orders; all which I conclude to
have been undoubted reliques of the antient <i>Lampsacus</i>. In the
yard of the <i>mosque</i> at <i>Jerdáck</i> I took the two following Greek
inscriptions</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">February</span> xxii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> nine this morning we transport ourselves and horses by
boat from <i>Jerdáck</i> to <i>Gallipoli</i>, and in three quarters of an hour
arrive by God’s blessing on the European shore; where we bid a
joyful farewel to that of Asia, after a severe sea sickness, which I
endured in the passage. At which time three years and three
months had passed, since my first arrival at <i>Smyrna</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Callipolis</span>, now called <i>Gallipoli</i>, was taken by the Turks in
the reign of <i>Orchán</i>, and <i>anno Hegirae</i> 760. It is now a city considerably
large, but thinly peopled, and decayed in commerce;
tho it still plentifully enjoys that of cottons and aniseed. It stands
upon a blunt point of land, betwixt two small open bays, of
which that to the north is exceeding pleasant, and has on its
green banks two fair Turkish sepulchers, the newer and more
magnificent being that of <i>Sinán pashá</i>. Adjoining is a <i>kane</i> of
very gentile fashion, with a <i>mosque</i>, and other instances of charity.
The southern bay has the walls of the antient arsenal, for
the lodging of stores and galleys, which formerly wintered in
this place. Besides which the vast rocks, which lie before the
town, are very remarkable; being a strange but natural mixture of
sand, pebbles, and cockleshells, of which materials all the houses
of the town are built. Here I saw a stone figure of our <i>Savior’s</i>
baptism in the river <i>Jordan</i>, with another of the <i>B. Virgin</i>, carved
contrary to the practice of the Greek church in <i>basso relievo</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">February</span> xxiii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> remain at <i>Gallipoli</i> this and the following day, expecting
Mr. Farington’s <i>caraván</i>. The breadth of the <i>Hellespont</i> is here
much inlarged, which at <i>Lampsacus</i>, according to <i>Xenophon</i>, was
but fifteen furlongs<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">February</span> xxv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> set forward from <i>Gallipoli</i> in a smooth and pleasant road,
which by degrees ascending begins quickly to show us the narrow
<i>isthmus</i> of the <i>Chersonésus</i>, with the <i>Propontis</i> on one side,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
and the gulph of <i>Cardia</i>, or <i>Sinus Melas</i>, on the other, the extreme
neck of land being scarce three miles broad. Our road now
inclines to the left hand, and so brings us round the blunt end
of the gulph, into which flows the fair river <i>Melas</i>, which about
the fourth hour from <i>Gallipoli</i> we cross at a regular and well built
stone bridge. Hence we have a stony and mountainous way to
<i>Allalmalée</i>, a Christian village, where we <i>conáck</i>. Before bed
time we had here the company of the poor ignorant παπᾶς, who
among other things told us, that he lately gave the bishop of <i>Heracléa</i>
seventy dollars to ordain his son a priest.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">February</span> xxvi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> depart from <i>Allalmalée</i>, and in two hours and a half arrive
at <i>Malgara</i>, where I observed a Turkish drink called <i>bozók</i>, being
a whitish thick beer made of millet seed. This is a large and pleasant
town, abounding in the production of honey, and bears the name
of a lady, who redeemed its security from plunder for a vast sum of
money, from the first Turkish conqueror. It is now reserved as a
place of banishment for the prime ministers of the empire. We proceed
homeward till about the sixth hour of this day’s journey, when
having lost my watch the preceding evening, we searched the company
upon some suspicion we had entertained of a <i>catergée</i>, who
yesterday joined us; and accordingly we find it concealed in the
corner of his breeches. In ten hours we arrive at <i>Derrícui</i> a small
Christian village, and there <i>conáck</i>. I must not omit, that this
day we discovered to the left the mountains of <i>Samothrace</i>, the
course of the <i>Hebrus</i>, and more forward the snowy top of <i>Rodope</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">February</span> xxvii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> two hours from our <i>conáck</i> we arrive at <i>Uzunkuprée</i>, a town
which has its name from the fair adjoining bridge of an hundred
and sixty six arches, and by <i>Saidino</i> is called <i>Ponte d’Erchiene</i><a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>. We
were the full space of fifteen minutes in passing this bridge, and towards
the further end, which is the most conspicuous part, we observed
ten or twelve heads carved on the battlements, that enclose
the bridge, in memory, as it is said, of so many chief workmen
strangled by <i>Sultan Morát</i> the first (who founded it) for building
it so narrow, as not to admit of two carts at once. In two hours
farther we arrive at the sandy and delicious banks of <i>Hebrus</i>, just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
opposite to the city and castle of <i>Dimotico</i>, where <i>Sultan Morát</i>
began to seat the palace of his emperial residence. From hence
we pass along the bank of that slow, but then plentiful river<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>,
and after two hours and a half take up our lodgings in a cold
inconvenient hovel at <i>Elchilée</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">February</span> xxviii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> five this morning we proceed in a level sandy road on the
banks of the <i>Hebrus</i>, where we observe a vast quantity of wild
fowl, and by nine arrive at the palace of my Lord Paget in
<i>Adrianople</i>, being filled with admiration at the beauty of the river,
campain, and prospect of so fair a city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Adrianople</span> is seated on the <i>Hebrus</i>, at the place where it
receives the <i>Tunsa</i> and the <i>Harda</i>. It is a fair and compact city,
about five miles in circumference, rising gently on the side of a
small hill from the banks of the <i>Hebrus</i> and <i>Tunsa</i><a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. What is there
remarkable, may be reduced to the <i>seraglio</i>, <i>mosques</i>, and <i>sharshées</i>.
The <i>seraglio</i> is built in a flat and verdant plain, at the
foot of the city betwixt the <i>Hebrus</i> and <i>Tunsa</i>, but more immediately
upon the banks of the latter. It is surrounded almost on
all sides with a thick grove of beech and elm, which within form
the resemblance of a park, and outwardly yeild a grateful prospect,
in regard that the countrey about it is almost wholly naked of
wood. A square wall encloses the fabric, which is truly mean,
and of a confused intricate figure; but, as is commonly said, well
contrived for convenience. The matter is plain free stone, and the
covering of lead. Nothing can be more grateful to the eye, than
the sight of this level verdant situation; and yet in regard of its
lowness, and too near approach to the rivers, nothing more
unwholesome. It seems to stand in the very same place, where
<i>Constantine</i> gave that famous defeat to <i>Licinnius</i><a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> <i>mosques</i> observable in this place are those called <i>Eskijamí</i>,
the <i>Three Sheríffs</i>, <i>Sultan Bajazet</i>, and <i>Sultan Selím</i>. The first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
of these is so called from its antiquity, which <i>Morát</i> the first here
established, and converted to that profane use from a Christian
church, of which it still retains the intire figure. The second is
to be observed for the abundance of porphyry, which appears in
the fabric, and the various architecture of the four <i>minarées</i>, together
with many serpentine pillars, which support the porticos of
the area. The third likewise has many serpentine pillars round
the area, and those of interrupted veins and distinct materials,
which seem to persuade one, that they are of a cast substance.
But the greatest beauty of this city, and as some think of the whole
empire, is the <i>mosque</i> of <i>Sultan Selím</i> the second, built by him
out of materials brought chiefly from the ruins of <i>Famagusta</i>,
in the island of <i>Cyprus</i>. Yet in regard that the area is not square,
nor supported with so rich or correspondent pillars, excepting four
that adorn the front, I esteem it inferior to the two noble <i>mosques</i>
of <i>Solymán</i> and <i>Achmét</i> at <i>Constantinople</i>. Otherwise it is a fair
structure, built with great conformity of its several parts, and like
a theatre consisting of one stately room ending upwards in a cupola.
It is adorned with four regular and beautiful <i>minarées</i>, each of
which has two hundred forty four stairs leading into the uppermost
balcony. For in each of them are three balconies, that imitate
the capitals of pillars, between which the whole body of the
column is regularly chanel’d. One of these is famous for having
three staircases winding one within another, of which one opens
into the three balconies, another into the two highest, and the
third only into the last of all. From thence we once took the opportunity
of viewing the several parts and precincts of the city, the
plat of the <i>seraglio</i>, the course of the rivers, and the face of the
countrey below, with the busy care of the several mortals, wandering
like so many ants on that spot of earth then subject to our
eye. Here I could not but pleasantly recollect those <i>templa serena</i>
of <i>Lucretius</i>, <i>L.</i> i. ℣. 8.</p>

<p class="noindent">Adjoining to <i>Sultan Bajazet</i> I was shewn a madhouse or bedlam,
which is a noble building of a round figure, covered with a regular
cupola, and having a large area in the middle, and therein
a cistern of water; but conveniently divided all round into six
chambers made archwise, and opening on one side into the area.
Here were kept three madmen, all furnished with clean mats, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
tied close down to the pavement by an iron chain fastned about
their neck for greater security.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> <i>sharshées</i> are two long and fair porticos, walled with brick
or stone on each side, and securely arched over head, so as to resist
fire. The shorter of these adjoins to <i>Sultan Selím</i>, and is appropriated
to the shoemakers: but the other, being about four
hundred paces long and six broad, is filled with shops of various
trades; all which are shallow niches in the wall of equal hight
and breadth, and in general so regularly contrived, that the whole
represents a beautiful and rich gallery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> whole way from <i>Gallipoli</i> to this place lies thro a campain
rich and fertile, abounding with villages, and those almost
all Christian. However it wants the lovely fountains, frequent
woods, and pretious shrubs of Asia.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">March</span> iv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Sir</span> Robert Sutton, successor to my Lord Paget in his embassy
to this port, who arrived at <i>Adrianople</i> about Christmas last, had
now his audience of the grand <i>vizír</i>. My Lord Paget, with the
retinue of his own family, and the English merchants now resident
in this place, repaired to the palace of his successor about
twelve a clock. At the same time came thither from the <i>vizír</i>,
the <i>chiaush bashá</i>, with an horse richly furnished for Sir Robert,
and about thirty others for the use of his retinue. From hence
the two ambassadors conducted by the <i>chiaush bashá</i>, and attended
by a large retinue of the English nation, proceeded to the palace
of the <i>vizír</i>. Upon their arrival into the room of audience, the
<i>vizír</i> soon entered, supported by his <i>kayá</i> and the <i>reis effendi</i>, and
congratulated with acclamations from his whole attendance. He
seated himself in a corner of the <i>sophá</i>, and the ambassadors sat
before him on two stools. After the old ambassador had presented
his successor, <i>Mauro Cordato</i>, who is master of the ceremonies,
and <i>dragoman</i> to the <i>Ottoman Port</i>, gave and returned the ordinary
forms. Then Sir Robert delivered his Majesty’s letter to
the <i>vizír</i>, after which both ambassadors were treated with coffee,
sherbet, and incense, and the whole ceremony at length concluded
with the distribution of about twenty four <i>caftans</i>. The <i>vizír</i>
is about sixty years of age, of short stature, and a meek serene<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
countenance; tho at this time somewhat moved with concern for
the loss of his only son of two years of age. At this ceremony
he appeared in the <i>selimée</i> turbant, which is a cap of state, and
was conceived to do an honour to the audience. It resembles the
form of a sugar loaf, only indented at the bottom on four sides,
and bound obliquely with a gold ribban.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">March</span> x.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Sir</span> Robert Sutton had his audience of the <i>Grand Signior</i> at
the <i>seraglio</i> of this place, whither he rode about seven a clock
on a horse of state, conducted as before by the <i>chiaush bashá</i>, and
attended by all the gentlemen of the English nation. At these
audiences it is the custom of the Turks to show somewhat of the
discipline of their soldiery, together with the process of their justice
at the <i>diván</i>. And therefore so soon as his Excellency entered
at the first gate of the <i>seraglio</i>, into a large and green court,
some companies of the <i>janisaries</i>, ranged on the opposite side,
ran with a great but orderly agility, to seize several dishes of
their broth, placed at equal distances on the area of the court;
after which they were remanded by the <i>churbegées</i>, who ran among
the ranks, and instead of words of command ordered them by a
certain gentle hissing into their respective stations. During this entertainment
his Excellency advanced towards the <i>diván</i>, which is an
oblong ground room, opening on the front into a gallery, by which
only it is separated from the court above mentioned. It is surrounded
on three sides with benches, covered with embroidered silk,
and the floor is laid with carpets; otherwise it has no ornaments,
nor embellishments of the walls. On the middle of the principal
bench, where it faces the door, sat the grand <i>vizír</i>, having
one crimson cushion under him, and another to support his feet,
by which only he is distinguished from other ministers of the <i>diván</i>.
On his right hand upon the same bench sat the <i>caimekám</i>,
and <i>Abdollá pashá</i> son of the late <i>Mustaphá Kioprili</i>; but
on his left hand the two <i>cadileskérs</i>, the one for Europe, and the
other for Asia. The two side benches were took up on the right
hand by the <i>nishangeé bashá</i>, and on the left by the <i>tefterdár</i>.
Sitting in this order, and maintaining a profound silence, they
dispatched several causes of <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>, in the sight of the ambassador
and his retinue; in which there was no other process, than
the reading several succinct cases to the <i>vizír</i>, together with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
depositions of the witnesses, upon which he pronounced his verdict,
and the parties were immediately dismissed. But in these,
and other affairs of the like kind, the <i>reis effendi</i> and <i>teskergée
bashá</i> also assist; the former of which acts as solicitor and secretary
to the <i>diván</i>, and the latter is the gentleman usher, who carries
all messages and papers betwixt the <i>Grand Signior</i> and the <i>vizír</i>.
In the mean time the <i>Grand Signior</i>, tho he is never personally
present in the <i>diván</i>, yet he is at his pleasure a witness and overseer
of all that passes there, by means of a lattice window, which
looks out of his apartments just over the seat of the <i>vizír</i>. These
ceremonies ended, there were brought in divers tables and placed
before the <i>vizír</i>, the <i>caimekám</i>, the <i>nishangée</i>, and the <i>tefterdár</i>;
all which being presently furnished with various Turkish dishes,
the ambassador sat down to eat with the <i>vizír</i>, and several gentlemen
of the English nation with the other ministers. After this
repast (the <i>vizír</i> having first demanded leave for an audience) the
ambassador and all the rest of the English gentlemen retired into
a distant part of the gallery, which fronts the chamber of the
<i>diván</i>, and other lodgings of the <i>seraglio</i>, where they were all
vested, and then sat down in order till the <i>diván</i> arose, and the
several ministers proceeded to the apartments of the <i>Grand Signior</i>,
the latter preceding, and the <i>vizír</i> closing the procession. Soon
after his Excellency was called to take his audience, to which himself,
and four gentlemen, who were permitted to follow him, were
conducted by two <i>capigées</i>, who led them on each hand, in a
rude and hasty manner. By these they were thus carried from
the outward gallery into a square paved court, and from thence
into a railed entry, that landed them immediately in a ground
room, which was the presence chamber of the <i>Grand Signior</i>. It
was a small room, of a square figure, lined on the sides and floor
with crimson silk, and that embellished with an high and thick
embroidery of golden branches. In one corner was erected an
high <i>sophá</i> about two yards square, adorned with four rich cushions,
and an answerable <i>minderá</i>, all of which were in a manner
intirely covered with embroidery of pearl. On this sat the
<i>Grand Signior</i>, regarding the ambassador in an oblique posture,
and sinking so deep in the <i>minderá</i>, that his thighs and legs were
not to be distinguished. The other ornaments of the room were
two windows, each furnished with two cushions, answerable to
those of the <i>sophá</i>; and more remarkable than all the rest, a
royal chimney cloth, embroidered like the covering of the floor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
and walls, but enriched beyond these with various large jewels
set in the corners of the work, such as pearls, diamonds, rubies,
emeralds and the like. The ambassador stood about three yards
distance from the <i>Grand Signior</i>, where he delivered himself to
<i>Mauro Cordato</i> in Italian, and he interpreted his credentials immediately
to the <i>Sultan</i>. But his Majesty’s letter being handed
to <i>Mauro Cordato</i> by his Excellency, it was by him delivered to
the <i>nishangée</i>, by him to <i>Abdollá pashá</i>, and by him to the <i>vizír</i>,
who laid it before the <i>Grand Signior’s</i> feet. Upon this the <i>Sultan</i>
directed himself to the <i>vizír</i> in these words: “We esteem the King
of England as our freind. On our part, all due regard shall be
had to the sacred capitulations made with him; and accordingly
be it your care to see them maintained.” This said, the ambassador
was dismissed the audience room, with the four gentlemen,
who only were permitted to attend the ceremony. Upon
which all the English immediately mounted at the outward gate
of the <i>seraglio</i>, and there stood in rank and order to see the <i>janisaries</i>
dismissed; which is done in a regular but hasty manner, and
seems to resemble the <i>decursio</i> of the Roman army. After this the
several Ministers of the <i>diván</i>, begining with the least, and ending
with the <i>vizír</i>, made a pompous procession on horses of state,
adorned with broad guilded bridles, and housing of the French
fashion, wrought with nothing but entire thread of gold. After
these followed his Excellency on an horse and furniture of the
same quality, and so returned with the attendance of several <i>chiaushes</i>,
and all those of the English nation, to his own palace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> habit of the several ministers of the <i>diván</i> is exactly of
the same form with the <i>caftans</i>, which they ordinarily present;
but the matter is either silk, or fine grogran, fur’d with
sable. Their turbant is that called the <i>mugevezée</i>; but that of the
<i>Grand Signior</i> is the same with the common <i>agás</i>, only distinguished
by three small, but fine and curious black feathers, with waves
of ash colour, being the outmost feathers on the wing of the <i>arguron</i>,
a rare Muscovian bird. The present made by the ambassador
to the <i>Grand Signior</i> consisted of sixty pieces of different
materials, as cloth, silk, sattin, velvet, and the like, all of them
at the charge of the company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">My</span> Lord Paget had this day his audience of leave of the grand
<i>vizír</i>, where, besides the ordinary forms and ceremonies of coffee,
sherbet, incense, and <i>caftans</i>, the letters of the <i>vizír</i> and <i>Sultan</i>
were brought in by the <i>reis effendi</i>; and being by him reverently
kissed and delivered to the <i>vizír</i>, were by the <i>vizír</i> kissed in the
same manner, and delivered to the ambassador, by whom they
were kissed again, and committed to Mr. Paget, who bore them
respectfully on his two hands during the whole procession to his
Excellency’s palace. The <i>Sultan’s</i> letter was enclosed in a cover of
cloth of gold, about a foot broad, and a yard long, being wrote
on fine Persian paper made of silk.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">March</span> xix.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">His</span> Excellency had audience of leave of the <i>mufti</i>, a reverend
person about seventy years of age, somewhat corpulent, of an insolent
and proud aspect, well learned in the Turkish law and
polity, and formerly <i>hogia</i> to the present <i>Sultan</i>. He is extremely
covetous, and at the same time prodigiously rich, having
hoarded, as it is said, one great part of the current gold of
the empire, and likewise purchased many vast and extensive
possessions about <i>Erzerum</i> and <i>Trebisond</i>, which is his native
countrey.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">March</span> xx.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">His</span> Excellency had audience of leave of the <i>caimekám</i>, a
courteous, affable, and obliging person, of no great estate or character,
except that his wife is sister to the <i>Sultan</i>. The same day,
being Friday, I saw the <i>Grand Signior</i> riding from his palace to
the <i>mosque</i>, where he paid his public devotion. He was preceded
by several <i>chiaushes</i>, then by six led horses, and then by several
<i>solácks</i>, habited in short vests, and adorned with high caps of gilt
silver. On each side of his horse walked three <i>churbegées</i>, bearing
on their heads so many beautiful white ostrich feathers; and
behind him followed on stately horses his <i>selictár agá</i>, and <i>kyslér
agá</i>. He is of a low stature, but broad and corpulent; has a
short neck, a large squat yellow fleshy face, a flat nose, a low
forehead, with cheeks remarkably long and squabby. In his coins<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
he stiles himself, <i>The mighty Sultan of the earth and sea, a Sultan
son of a Sultan, Sultan Mustafá Han, son of emperor Mahomet</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">March</span> xxi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">His</span> Excellency had audience of leave of the <i>nakéib effendi</i>, who
is the son of the <i>mufti</i>, and by patent the designed successor of
his father. He is about thirty years of age, of good parts and
behaviour, naturally arrogant, but made shew on this occasion of
an affected courtesy.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">March</span> xxiv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">I this</span> day saw the heads of five robbers brought from <i>Natolia</i>,
and laid at the gate of the <i>seraglio</i>, where by custom they are to
remain three suns. They are only the skins of so many criminals
heads stuffed with straw.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> ii. <i>A. D.</i> 1702.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">His</span> Excellency, my Lord Paget, now drawing near to his departure
was this day invited to the grand <i>vizír’s</i>, where among
many singular tokens of that esteem, which this court truely bears
to his person and character, he received a splendid feast, together
with the present of a sable vest to the value of two purses; as
also a noble horse, and sumptuous furniture, computed at three
more.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> iii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">I saw</span> the extravagant devotion of an enthusiastic sect of Turks
which they publicly acted in the manner following. After their
ordinary midday <i>namáz</i> at a little <i>mosque</i> of this city, they repaired
to an adjoining chapel, where were seated many Turks of
different quality, who came thither as spectators only, and to entertain
their curiosity. These several devotées, who were to act
their part, were decently ranked in circular seats, till the prior
of their order entered, on which they all rose to reverence him.
He immediately seated himself in the corner of the room, and
with the whole fraternity struck up a religious hymn, which they
carried on in a decent, solemn, and harmonious manner. This
done, they rose upon their feet, to the number of about sixty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
persons, and form’d themselves into a close ring, each one holding
his hands on the breast and neck of his foreman. In this posture
they advanced round, repeating with a deep and forcible voice,
<i>Hú hú</i>; at the same time stamping violently on the ground, and
with great force throwing their heads towards the center of the
ring. Soon after two step’d within the circle, and turn’d swiftly
upon their heel; upon which the whole company quickened their
motion, and grew into a warmth and fury, which is rather to be
admired, than expressed in words. For two hours and an half
they acted a continual fury, sometimes huging one another in a
cluster, at other times kneeling in a confused company, and then
runing round in a circle without cessation<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>, throwing about their
hands, tossing their heads, and repeating in hidious cries, <i>Hú
héy</i>, <i>Alláh hulláh</i>, <i>Allá hú</i>, or, <i>Allá héy</i>. As they grew hoarser and
weaker, both their sound and action exactly resembled the barking
and snarling of dogs<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>; till at length being covered with
sweat, and worked up to the last pitch of extasy, they concluded
with certain versicles, which they repeated from the mouth
of the prior, and so dismissed us<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> iv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">My</span> Lord Paget paid his last visit this morning to the <i>vizír

the afternoon he likewise took his last leave of the <i>reis effendi</i>,
who honoured him with the like present, and dismissed him with
expressions, that witnessed the sincere and cordial respect he bore
him. I shall conclude this narrative with observing only, that about
<i>Adrianople</i> grows an excellent red wine, which I take to be that
mentioned by <i>Hesiod</i> in his <i>Oper et Dies</i>, <i>L.</i> ii. ℣. 107, where he

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> viii. <i>A. D.</i> 1702.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day about ten a clock my Lord Paget set out from
<i>Adrianople</i>, and began his journey homeward with a splendid
equipage. First proceeded two <i>chiaushes</i>, and six <i>janisaries</i>;
then the three flags of the <i>arms of England</i>, the <i>union</i>, and <i>St.
George</i>, after these the gentlemen of the horse, with thirteen led
horses; next the <i>agá</i>, appointed by the government to conduct
his Excellency; who was followed by four coaches, each drawn
by six horses, in the last of which rode his Excellency himself,
and in the first some gentlemen, who accompanied him in this
journey; namely, Count <i>Gylderstope</i> of Sweden, Mr. George
Montague, nephew to my Lord Hallifax, and his tutor Mr. <i>Gangain</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">For</span> conveniency of carriage, and accommodations of the journey,
his Excellency was furnished with seventy one waggons, which
were to attend him to the extreme bounds of the Turkish empire,
at the sole charge of the Port. Tho this was but the least mark
of esteem, which he received from thence; as it may be reasonably
computed, that they presented him to the value of near
twenty purses of money, since his last arrival at <i>Adrianople</i>, in the
following particulars. For the fitting up of his palace in that city,
five hundred dollars: for the cushions and other furniture of two
<i>sophá</i> rooms, six hundred: for a stately horse from the grand <i>vizír</i>,
five hundred: for the rich furniture of the same, a thousand: for
a sable vest at the same time, a thousand: for an horse and furniture
from the <i>vizír kayá</i>, five hundred: for the like from the
<i>reis effendi</i>, five hundred: for fifteen mules from the government,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
at about fifty dollars each, seven hundred and fifty: for seventy
two horses from the same, at thirty dollars each, two thousand one
hundred and sixty: and lastly for one hundred days <i>tain</i>, or <i>allowance</i>,
from the Port, at the rate of fifty dollars a day, making
five thousand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day his Excellency and his retinue travel slowly about
the space of fifteen miles, and about three a clock arrive at a
small village called <i>Senigée</i>, where we find the waggons disposed
in their several stations, the apartments of each company alloted,
and three tents (tho not pitched this evening) ready for the service
of his Excellency; which I here mention once for all, as being
the constant method of each following <i>conáck</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> ix.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">From</span> <i>Senigée</i> we proceed this morning in three hours to <i>Cokúck
Derocut</i>, and from thence in the like time to <i>Boiák Dervent</i>,
where we find his Excellency’s tents orderly and conveniently
placed, and all things regularly disposed for this night’s lodging.
Here we saw an old Bulgar Christian, named <i>Staón</i>, aged one
hundred and twenty years<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>; who told us, that he had all his
life time been subject to great and continual sickness, and had
three times changed his teeth, once in his infancy, and twice in
his old age. They were now for the most part intire, his senses
of hearing and tasting very lively, and his sight but little decayed;
his beard and his eyebrows lately became perfectly black, but
the hair of his head milk white, and the skin of his breast like
the bark of an old weather beaten beech.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> x.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> travel this day from <i>Dervent</i> to <i>Jenícui</i>, having hitherto
found the country to consist of a level campain, and a soil that
promised fertility, were it more happily furnished with inhabitants,
water, and wood.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> now proceed from <i>Jenícui</i> to <i>Pashácui</i>, so called from the
residence of <i>Achmét Gerai Sultan</i>, who is a Tartar prince, happily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
banished from his own barbarous country to this fair and delightful
village, situated in a verdant plain, that is better furnished
with wood, than the campain we had lately passed; and watered
with a small river, which seems to rise from the bowels of mount
<i>Haemus</i>, and bend its course towards the <i>Tunsa</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">From</span> <i>Pashácui</i> we arrive at <i>Comorwa</i>, a rich well cultivated
village, and plentifully supplied both with wood and water. In our
way hitherto from <i>Adrianople</i> we sometimes observed drummers,
placed in the nature of watchmen, to give notice of the security
of the road.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xiii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">From</span> <i>Comorwa</i> we proceed in two hours and a half to <i>Dobral</i>,
leaving in view to the right hand a large Turkish town called
<i>Cornibat</i>, famous for dying, and preparing the fine purple and
yellow leather of this country, which it vends in great quantities.
From <i>Dobral</i> we begin to ascend the foot of <i>Haemus</i>,
where the way winds so artificially, as to take away the difficulty
of ascent. Here crossing a rapid river, which forms its chanel in
the body of the mountain, and thro a variety of diverting shades
and clifts, we arrive at length at an open plain on the top of the
hill, and therein at a true country paradise of Bulgar Christians
called <i>Challikcavák</i><a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>; where a new church has been lately obtained
for the inhabitants, by the interest of Count <i>Oetingh</i>, embassador
extraordinary from his Imperial Majesty. Here the damsels
of the parish entertained us this evening with a dance, which
tho performed with no great art or variety, yet had a certain plainness
and simplicity, which was truly grateful. The women here
wear as ornaments, a sort of cravat consisting of various silver
coins, and large bossy silver bracelets; who dismissed us the next
morning with corn strewed in our way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xiv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">On</span> the top of the hill we proceed for some time in a level
road, thro a stately grove of oaks; after which the way begins
to descend, and being shortened by the pleasure of the shady
scene on each side, leads unexpectedly into the adjoining plain.
In this we travel about an hour, near the foot of the delightful
<i>Haemus</i>, and then find our quarters ready to receive us at a Christian
village, called <i>Trágoe</i>. And indeed all the villages, which we
had hitherto passed from <i>Adrianople</i>, were intirely inhabited by
Christians, who by nation are Bulgarians, but by their faith of
the Greek communion.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> still continue our journey at the foot of the mountain,
till in an hour’s time we arrive at <i>Eskí Stambol</i>; from whence the
way, now leaving <i>Haemus</i> at our backs, carries us in four hours more
to the first Turkish village, which had occurred in our progress,
called <i>Boklar</i>. Mount <i>Haemus</i> being the limit, that divides
<i>Thracia</i> from <i>Bulgaria</i>, or <i>Moesia Inferior</i> of the antients, we
made this day’s journey in the latter; which hereabouts appears
as pleasant, as a just mixture of hills and vales, woods and lawns,
arable and pasture ground can make it. The above mentioned
<i>Eskí Stambol</i> is a name given by the Turks to the remains of an
ancient city (possibly the <i>Oescus Triballorum</i>) which at the foot of
<i>Haemus</i> shews the intire tract of two walls; the inward square,
and of about a mile in circumference; the outward almost circular,
and containing the compass of five miles. But besides these
it has no reliques of carved work, or any inscription, that may
give light to the true name or history of the place. In one corner
only of the inward wall are several crosses, and an image of
the Παναγία, or <i>Virgin Mother</i>, barbarously cut, with two or three
rude lines of modern Greek characters, in which nothing but the
word Βασηλίσαν, or <i>Queen</i>, was now legible, and that corruptly
written, as it is here copied. By the abovementioned walls runs a
small river from the <i>Haemus</i>, now called by the Italians <i>Monte
Argentato</i>, and by the Turks <i>Batkán</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xvi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Over</span> a country, which is truly rich, as well as pleasant, and
curiously varied by easy ascents and descents, we proceed in five
hours from <i>Trágoe</i> to <i>Arnoútcui</i>; a village whose inhabitants are of
the Greek communion, tho its name implies them to be of Albanian
original.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xvii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Thro</span> a pleasant tract of country, containing a grateful variety
of arable ground, pasture, and woods, we arrive in seven hours
at <i>Uzungée Alon</i>. By the way we passed several villages, as likewise
a large market town, wherein are seven <i>mosques</i>, and a
palace of the <i>pashá</i> of <i>Nicopoli</i>, which goes by the name of
<i>Rásgrad</i>. The <i>cadí</i> of this place, with an <i>alaí chiaush</i>, and other
officers, came an hour out of town to meet his Excellency.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xviii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Thro</span> a like country, only a little more woody, we continue
our journey to <i>Uppéer</i>. And from thence the day following,
where we first begin to see the <i>Danube</i>, we proceed thro a rich,
pleasant, and well cultivated country, till about twelve a clock
we arrive at <i>Tutracán</i>, on the banks of the river.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xx.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> stay at this place, employed in the care of transporting his
Excellency’s equipage on the other side of the water; and in the
mean time cannot but reflect with pleasure on the agreable tract
of ground, which for five days we had passed thro in <i>Moesia Inferior</i>.
A country, which (however decried by Ovid, and disparaged
by our modern geographers) for the richness of its soil,
variety of rising and falling ground, elegancy of prospect, and a
competent provision of wood and water, is perhaps not to be paralleled
by any other spot in the universe. But tho the whole
tract of this country, which descends gradually from the foot of
the <i>Haemus</i> to the banks of the <i>Danube</i>, is rich both in arable and
pasture ground; yet the inhabitants seem excessive poor, and are
defended from the injuries of the weather by houses very meanly
built.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xxi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">His</span> Excellency and his retinue this day pass the <i>Danube</i>, between
<i>Tutracán</i> and the mouth of the <i>Argisch</i>, about eight in
the morning, at a passage about a mile broad. Upon landing, his
Excellency was complimented from the Prince of <i>Valachia</i> by
his cousin german Count <i>Tomáso Cantacuzéno</i>, and was received
by a guard of fifty men, and two coaches of six. In the finer of
these his Excellency rode about a mile into <i>Valachia</i>, along the
banks of the <i>Argisch</i>, and then alighting was entertained under
three rich tents, sent likewise by the Prince for his reception.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xxii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">His</span> Excellency continued his journey about six hours thro the
<i>Valachian</i>, a country which on this side is exactly level, and
luxuriantly rich, but desolate for want of culture and inhabitants.
In the road we meet with wooden crosses, erected in many places
to excite the devotion of Christian travelers; as also a convent of
monks about two hours short of our <i>conáck</i>, near which the
<i>Argisch</i> receives the chanel of the <i>Dembowitza</i>. At length we
arrive at a miserable collection of cottages, scarce deserving the
name of a village, but blessed with the convenience of a delicious
and healthy water; where we find the tents both of the
Prince and his Excellency ready pitched for his entertainment
this evening. We were conducted hither by Count <i>Tomáso</i>, who
undertook the care of the public <i>tain</i> to be furnished for his Excellency.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xxiii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> proceed four hours thro a pleasant wood, enriched with
<i>lilia convallium</i>, and other flowers; and at length pitch our tents
at <i>Popest</i>, which in the <i>Valachian</i> language signifies the same as
<i>Priest-town</i>. Here about five in the evening his Excellency received
an express by Baron <i>Minsheim</i> from Count <i>Rabutin</i>, with
the most unhappy news of the death of his Britannic Majesty, on
the eighth past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xxiv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">About</span> seven this morning his Excellency set forward, and
prepared for his entrance into <i>Bucurest</i>, which is distant about an
hour and half from <i>Popest</i>. Not far from his <i>conáck</i> he was
met by a rich coach from the Prince of <i>Valachia</i>, complimented
by his two eldest sons, and attended with a guard of about five
hundred men. His Excellency having mounted the coach, preceded
by the guard, made his entry about nine a clock; when he
was conducted to a spare palace of the Prince, near that of his own
residence, and entreated to use it as his own home. It is a fair
and gentile house, built of stone, and covered agreably to the
custom of this place with wooden tiles; and being furnished with
apartments after the Christian fashion, may be esteemed magnificent,
when compared with the barbarous edifices of the neighbouring
Turks. From the front it looks into a large garden, and
from the right wing into another of somewhat a lesser size; both
which are agreable, and afford a convenience of shade and
verdure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> afternoon the Prince came on horseback thro the lesser
garden to visit his Excellency, who met him at the garden door,
and could scarce prevail with him to precede in going up stairs.
He returned in an hour, and gave opportunity to his uncle,
<i>Constantinus Cantacuzenus</i>, who has the office of grand <i>stolnicho</i>,
or <i>steward</i>, in this court, to pay my Lord the same compliment.
The name of the Prince is <i>Joannes Constantinus Bassarabas</i>, who
has enjoyed the principality about thirteen years, having succeeded
<i>Serbanus Cantacuzenus</i>, brother of the above mentioned <i>Constantinus
Stolnichus</i>. He is a promoter of good order and discipline
in the province, a reviver of architecture, and incourager
of learning both at <i>Bucurest</i> and other places of the principality;
into which he has introduced two or three printing presses, and
from thence published several books useful for the instruction and
edification of the Greek church. He is about forty seven years
of age, and has ten children, four of them sons; the second of
whom, being about fourteen years of age, is well instructed in the
Latin and Greek languages. He is of an affable, mild, and courteous
temper; generous, careful of the education of his family,
and a great encourager of religion; and therefore liberal in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
disbursements for printing and giving away books, erecting of
monasteries, adorning of churches, and other acts of piety. His
uncle, <i>Constantinus Cantacuzenus Stolnichus</i>, is an elderly person,
who has traveled over most parts of Europe; is skilled in the
controversies of their own church, as well as in the several liberal
sciences; is also well versed in politics, and by his counsels chiefly
sustains the present Prince, with the honour and interest of the
principality.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xxv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> nine this morning his Excellency returned the visit to the
Prince, who received him at the head of the stairs, and entertained
him at first with a conference of about an hour and half long.
After this his Excellency was conducted into the dining room,
where, at a long table sumptuously spread, the Prince and his Excellency
(the former on the right hand) sat down to diner. On
the side of his Excellency sat the two eldest sons of the Prince,
his son in law, with the other nobles and officers of the court.
On the side of the Prince sat in order the retinue of the ambassador,
with our conductor Count <i>Tomaso</i> and others. The feast was
protracted at least seven hours, during which passed a great variety
of courses, consisting of excellent and costly dishes, with plenty
of exquisite wine, and many ceremonious healths; the principal
of which were to the <i>Grand Signior</i>, the <i>Emperor of Germany</i>,
and the <i>Queen of England</i>, all seconded with salvoes from the soldiery
in the adjoining court. Here we were made witnesses to a
singular air of courtesy, hospitality, and gentile behavior in the
Valachian nobility; but more particularly in the Prince himself,
who drank to the health and prosperity of each stranger at the
table. At the conclusion of the entertainment he veiled his
Excellency with a rich silk robe of the Valachian fashion, lined
with an excellent sable fur, upon which his Excellency and his
retinue return to their own lodgings. The palace of the Prince,
with the apartments, and gardens adjoining, are truly noble and
magnificent; and tho not to be compared with those of some other
Christian princes, yet much preferable to those, in which the ignorant
Turks so ambitiously please themselves.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xxvi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> morning we had divine service and a sermon in his Excellency’s
family, and in the afternoon he paid a short visit to
the Patriarch of <i>Jerusalem</i>, but afterwards a much longer to the
abovementioned <i>Constantinus Cantacuzenus Stolnichus</i>. The Patriarch
lodges in a large <i>kane</i>, built by the present Prince; where
are large apartments and magazines for merchants, the rent of
which may yeild about twenty purses <i>per annum</i>, and is by the
Prince consigned into that Patriarch’s hands for the use of the
<i>Holy sepulcher</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xxvii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">I visited</span> the press of this place, where I found them printing
some pieces of devotion in Arabic, under the care of the Patriarch
of <i>Antioch</i> to be distributed by him about his diocess. Beside
this, they were undertaking to print a large <i>folio</i> of the famous
<i>Maximus Hieromonachus</i>, called Κυριακοδρόμιον, or <i>The course of
the several Sundays throughout the year</i>. On this occasion I there
bought several books, among which one containing all the <i>Liturgies</i>,
<i>Hymns</i>, <i>Rituals</i>, <i>Lessons</i>, and other devotional tracts, used on
all occasions in the Greek church through the course of the whole
year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> morning the Prince gave his Excellency another visit, which
he returned in the afternoon, and at the same time took leave, with
a deep sense of the generous, honourable, and affectionate treatment
he had received in this court. After his return from the Prince,
he received a visit of leave from <i>Constantinus Cantacuzenus Stolnichus</i>,
who then presented him with a gentile horse of the Valachian
breed, and at the same time two of the same breed and
quality were sent him from the Prince, upon which his Excellency
answered the present of <i>Constantinus</i> with a diamond ring, valued
at three hundred pounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> same day I was favoured with a present of several Greek
books, lately printed in this province, from Κῦρ Γεώργιος Καστριώτης;
as likewise of some others from his Excellency <i>Constantinus
Cantacuzenus</i>. Towards the evening our curiosity led us half an hour
out of town to visit a convent, called in the Valachian tongue the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
<i>Catrochán</i>, and founded by the late Prince <i>Serbanus Cantacuzenus</i>.
It is accounted the most beautiful of several in this province, founded
by the present and preceding princes; and therefore a short
account of this may serve for a specimen of the rest. It is situated
on the <i>Dembowitza</i>, which washes it on two sides; while the
other two are adorned with a grove of lovely, close, and shady
oaks. The neighbouring pastures afford an entertaining prospect,
whereas the parts nearer to the convent are disposed into orderly
vineyards, and gardens. The fabric it self is an oblong quadrangle,
built of regular and massy stone, divided into cells for
about forty monks, with lodgings for the abbot, a common refectory,
kitchin, and other public apartments. But in the middle
of the area is erected the chapel, of the exact figure of the antient
Greek churches, that is, distinguished into the νάρθηξ or <i>porch</i>,
πρόναος or <i>outward chapel</i>, νάος or <i>body of the church</i>, βῆμα or
<i>chancel</i>, and θυσιαστήριον or <i>altar</i>; the several parts being regular
and stately, supported with pillars, and covered with high cupolas.
The ornaments of painting, gilding, and embroidery are
exceeding rich; and the pictures so numerously disposed, as to
possess every part of the church in the inside, as well as the outside
of the front. Here is shewn the monument of <i>Serbán</i> the
founder, with his princess, his brother, and other relations; whose
pictures, among others, possess a great part of the western wall.
Here also are kept the two <i>horse tails</i>, allowed by the Turks to
be carried before this prince, together with the <i>bandiéra</i> of the
province, and another called the <i>paschal colours</i>, in which the
whole <i>Trinity</i> is profanely represented, and <i>God the Father</i> expressed
by the image of a reverend old man, looking over the body
of our <i>Savior</i>, as it hangs upon the cross.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Bucurest</span> is a large stragling town of a very peculiar make,
the outward parts very mean, consisting of houses, the greater
part of which is under ground like our cellars, and covered over
at the top with straw or bark of trees. The better sort of houses
are about the palace of the Prince, which are covered with handsome
wooden tiles, the walls built of substantial stone, and the
yards and gardens always very wide<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>, enclosed with intire trunks
of oaks set as near as possible to each other. The streets appear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
like a continued bridge, being floored from side to side with
massy planks of ten yards long, and as many inches thick; which
work, however expensive it may seem, is continued thro all the
buildings of the place for the extent of some miles together. The
sight of the whole is agreable at a distance, by reason of the several
houses of the nobility, the palace of the Prince, and the
number of churches and convents. These last are all of one
form, regularly built, and rising with cupolas, wherein bells are
often hung; which I mention, as being the first I had heard
since my arrival in Turkey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> whole province is luxuriantly rich, abounding with woods
and pastures, but thinly inhabited, and that in caves and huts
rather than houses. Its chief income proceeds from wax, honey,
hides, horses, the mines of salt, and custom on some places of the
<i>Danube</i>. By these it is able to maintain its prince and barons
splendidly, besides paying a yearly tribute to the Turk, that is
settled at three hundred and twenty purses, which are equal to
thirty two thousand pounds sterling, besides three times that sum
extorted beyond the compact. The lands of the province are intirely
in the hands of the Prince and barons; the rest, who are
rustics, being all either slaves or servants, whose persons or service
are at the disposal of the several nobles, on whom they depend.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xxviii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> proceed this morning from <i>Bucurest</i>, and after five hours
travel take up our lodging at a small village, called <i>Chrytshulest</i>.
In the way we stop a little towards the right hand to visit a gentile
palace, which is building by the Prince for his second son, situated
on a pleasant lake. And the day following, in seven hours from
<i>Chrytshulest</i>, we pitch our tents, and lodge near a small river,
called <i>Ilsós</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">April</span> xxx.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day about twelve a clock we arrive at <i>Tergovist</i>, where
his Excellency and his retinue are lodged in the palace of the
Prince. The form and state hereof much resembles that of <i>Bucurest</i>;
only it has the advantage of a much finer garden, and
therein of a beautiful stone summer house; both which are regular,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
and may compare with those of the politer Christendom.
The town is pleasantly situated on the <i>Ialomitza</i>, beyond which it
enjoys the prospect of a beautiful tract of hills, which make the
boundary betwixt this province and that of <i>Transylvania</i>; but on
the other hand, the eye loses itself in an even boundless plain, encircled
at a large distance with stately woods. The city gives title
to the chief Metropolite of Valachia, and in like manner, till within
these thirty years, was the residence of their princes; when a
rebellion against the Turks being here formed by Prince <i>Ghika</i>,
and the neighbourhood of Transylvania contributing to render the
place more suspected, his successors were constrained to demolish
it, and retire to <i>Bucurest</i>. But within five years the present
Prince has obtained fresh leave to reestablish it, on condition he
erects no fortifications in the place; and accordingly it begins apace
to be repeopled, while the Prince refits his palace, embellishes
his gardens, and invites the nobility to erect their respective
houses, that so they may attend him in those frequent residences,
which for the future he intends to make here.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> i.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> took the opportunity of the stay, we this day made at <i>Tergovist</i>,
to go after diner to a convent situated on the adjoining
hills; which we found well built of fair freestone, adorned with
cupolas well carved in lattice work of the same matter; but
above all commanding a delightful prospect over the subject plain,
and city of <i>Tergovist</i>, which on account of the palaces, the seats
of the nobility, and the many fair convents and churches there
extant, affords an entertaining landskip.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> ii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day we travel four hours from <i>Tergovist</i>, and at length
pitch our tents in a pleasant place, surrounded with pendent woods,
by the name of <i>Isvóra</i>, not far from the stream of the <i>Dembowitza</i>,
which yet continued to flow on our left hand.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> iii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> morning we proceed, and within half an hour arrive at
the foot of the mountains, where the <i>Dembowitza</i> descends into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
the plain thro an easy clift, which it perhaps has partly formed
by the continual and rapid course of its stream. Thro this plain
we travel seven hours, in which time we are obliged to cross the
winding chanel of the river twenty times or upwards; and being
constantly diverted by the murmur of the falling waters; by
the shade of the shelving hills that form the vale, and by the
evenness of the ascent which imperceptibly leads us up the mountains,
we at length pitch in a fair meadow inclosed like a theatre
with surrounding trees and hills, where is a small village by the
name of <i>Cotonést</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> iv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> continue our journey four hours thro the same sort of way,
that is, along a narrow shady vale, which conveys the winding waters
of the <i>Dembowitza</i>; which having crossed several times, we
at length arrive at the village of <i>Dragoslave</i>, and in half an hour
farther at that of <i>Rukar</i>, in the Greek map, Ῥούναλο, where we
pitch and repose this evening. This village is considerably large,
consisting of houses all of the Valachian fashion, that is, built
round with trees laid even upon one another, covered with an
high and deep roof consisting of wooden tiles, and within having
no funnel or chimney to convey the smoke, but open only in several
parts of the roof to supply that defect.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> v.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Being</span> now imperceptibly advanced almost as high as the snowy
tops of the mountain, which we see at a near distance impending
over the village, where we lodge, we are informed, that the
remaining ascent for the space of half an hour is very difficult,
and that afterwards we are to encounter a much more troublesome
descent. His Excellency therefore thought fit to repose here this
day, and to take that opportunity of sending before him his waggons,
coaches, and the greatest part of his baggage; that on the
morrow, when he himself was to set forward, he might pass with
the greater ease. In the mean time, considering that we then
hoped to pass the limits, that separate the two provinces of <i>Transylvania</i>
and <i>Valachia</i>, it will be here proper to set down such
general remarks, as occurred in traveling thro the latter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> province was under the Romans from <i>Trajan</i> to <i>Gallienus</i>,
or rather to <i>Aurelian</i>; who, tho he was born here, yet translated
the remainder of the Romans hence into <i>Moesia</i> and <i>Pannonia</i>.
When it became tributary to the Turks by force of arms,
it was glad to accept the imposition of three hundred and twenty
purses yearly; whilst <i>Moldavia</i>, which voluntarily submitted to
that yoke, was assessed at no more than sixty. Ever since, the
nomination of their prince has entirely resided in the Turk, who
nevertheless allows him all rights of sovereignty in the principality,
except that of declaring war, and coining his own money.
That which ordinarily passes in this countrey, is therefore either
the Dutch, or Venetian <i>lion dollars</i>; with the <i>quarts</i> of Poland;
and a small Saxon coin, here called <i>bains</i>, of which one hundred
thirty two make a <i>lion dollar</i>. Justice is here performed according
to the ancient laws of the province, which are agreable to the
Roman law. The power and act of pronouncing sentence is
wholly in the prince, after which, as commonly in Turkey, the
execution immediately ensues. For the better adjustment of tribute,
and other common duties, the whole province is divided
into seventeen counties, of which each is to furnish its respective
proportion. In time of war it ordinarily maintains twenty thousand
men, of which about the fourth part continue in pay in the
time of peace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> natives ordinarily call themselves <i>Romans</i>, and their province
<i>Tzerra Romanesca</i><a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>, being persuaded that they are descended
of that original. And in favour of this opinion they may allege
their language, which is a broken mixture of Latin and Italian,
into which have been accidentally adopted some few Turkish and
Sclavonic words. They write intirely the Cyrillian Sclavonic character,
which seems to be a detortion from the Greek. And
these properties of their language, as well as the character<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>, they
have in common with <i>Moldavia</i>; which two provinces, together
with <i>Transylvania</i>, constituted the ancient <i>Dacia</i>, the two former
<i>Ripensis</i>, and the last <i>Mediterranea</i>. The wines of this province,
especially about <i>Tergovist</i>, are exquisite fine. The Valachian
habit much resembles that of the Turks. Their religion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
is intirely that of the Greek church, and the government of it
subject to the Patriarch of Constantinople. Their liturgic rites
are performed either in the Greek or Sclavonian tongue; tho I was
assured, that in some churches the Valachian was admitted, at
least they have frequently the <i>Gospels</i> and other offices in that language,
but the liturgy itself more rarely. The churches of each
parish, as well as chapels of the many monasteries, which are seen
here, are usually very fair, well built, richly adorned, profanely
painted, and for the most part furnished with bells; tho in some
places I have observed the wooden plank, which is common to
the Greeks in Turkey, where bells are not permitted. The νάρθηξ,
or <i>porch</i>, is generally daubed with superstitious representations of
the punishments of hell; and often the inward walls are profaned
with some inconsistent corporeal image of <i>God the Father</i>, a thing
here permitted against the professed principles and declarations of
the Greek church.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> vi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> proceed this day over the mountain, on a steep craggy rocky
way, lined on each side with an dismal shade, and sometimes
looking down into a frightful precipice. By half an hour after
ten we arrive at the limits of the two provinces, which are distinguished
by a wooden cross on the edge of the mountain, from
whence the prospect begins to open into <i>Transylvania</i>. Here my
Lord was saluted from the government of <i>Transylvania</i> by Count
<i>Michael Mikes</i>, as well as from the magistrates of <i>Cronstadt</i> by
their deputy, and at the same time attended by a troop of horse,
with the colours of the Emperor, as his ordinary guard; upon
which the troop of <i>Cosacks</i>, which had hitherto guarded his Excellency
from <i>Tergovist</i>, returned home. In one hour and an half
from hence we descend the mountain, and at a narrow passage,
where the river <i>Bozza</i> finds its passage out of the snowy hills into
the adjoining plain, we arrive at the castle of <i>Bran</i>, a small fortress
which defends this pass; where his Excellency was saluted, as he
passed, with three different salvos of about twenty one guns.
Within canon shot of this fort we find a fair set of huts, ready
pitched for the reception of his Excellency, with a buttery, kitchen,
and other accommodations, provided for his use by the abovesaid
Count <i>Mikes</i>; who now undertook the care of the public allowance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
and conduct of his Excellency from this place, as far as
<i>Hermanstadt</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> vii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> six this morning we set forward from the castle of <i>Bran</i>,
directing our course for <i>Cronstadt</i>, being now about two Hungarian
miles, or twelve Italian, distant from it. In half an hour
his Excellency was met by major general <i>Glychensberg</i>, governor
of the forces at <i>Cronstadt</i> and the parts adjoining; together with
lieutenant colonel <i>Graven</i> of the regiment of general <i>Rabutin</i>.
The same civility he received from the judge and other magistrates
of the city, with whom, and the numerous retinue which
came along with them, we now proceed, making a train of a mile
long. In the mean time our road lay thro that spot of ground,
on which general <i>Heusler</i> was defeated, and made prisoner by
Count <i>Tekely</i> in the year sixteen hundred and ninety; as also thro
the town of <i>Rosnaw</i>, lying in the middle betwixt <i>Bran</i> and <i>Cronstadt</i>,
where there is a considerable castle, which likewise saluted
his Excellency, as he passed, with three repeated salvos. About
eleven a clock we enter the city, the castle repeating continual
salvos, which we find all in arms, and the streets lined on both
sides with musqueteers, as also the whole soldiery drawn up in
order in the market place. In this is the house of general <i>Glychensberg</i>,
where his Excellency was received with all marks of respect
and honour, and in an hour’s time invited to a noble entertainment.
After diner, by order of Count <i>Mikes</i>, we were attended
to our several stations, where a Transylvanian gentleman was appointed
to act as commissary, or <i>proveditóre</i>, in each respective quarter.
Particularly Mr. Paget and myself were favoured with the
company and attendance of one <i>Lodislaus Doeza</i>, a civil, intelligent,
and well behaved gentleman of the Helvetian confession.
And this afternoon Mr. Paget and I walked up the castle hill, from
whence we had a prospect of the city, which is almost triangular,
enclosed with a stone wall, situated in a narrow vale, under an
high snowy clift of mountains, but on one side looking towards
a level and fruitful plain. It is surrounded with three distinct
suburbs, beautifully intermixed with gardens; and in one part of
these suburbs, which runs more within the hills, stands an handsome
Valachian church. A dreadful fire about fourteen years
since laid the whole town in ashes, and at the same time utterly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
consumed the library of the school, which is here instituted for
teaching of philosophy and theology. The same calamity almost
ruined the cathedral church, of which now nothing but the outward
case remains to testify its former grandeur; the roof, which
was of arched stone, being now only covered with boards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> general religion of this place is Lutheran; and the church
above mentioned is governed by a dean and thirteen capitularies,
who enjoy considerable rents from the thirteen parishes of the district
of <i>Cronstadt</i>, which are supplied by them. The ecclesiastical
government of the whole district is partly in this chapter, and
partly in the superintendent of <i>Cronstadt</i>; which office is sometimes
distinct, but for the most part held together with the deanry;
and from this superintendent appeals lie to the bishop of the
whole province of Transylvania.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> civil government of the town is in a judge elected every
two years, a senate, and a commonalty of an hundred men. The
sentence of the judge is final, and is governed by laws of the
place model’d according to the civil law. The city since the
fire is fairly rebuilt, with a certain regularity of walls and windows
to the street, and the roofs are all covered, as in <i>Valachia</i>, with
wooden tiles. The common language is Saxon; this being one
of the cities, which belong to the great colony of that nation,
which makes one third of <i>Transylvania</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> ix.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> morning we depart from <i>Cronstadt</i> at six a clock by the
way of <i>Feketeholm</i>, which has a church fortified like a garrison.
From thence we proceed thro woods and hills to <i>Veledin</i>; where
in a cold watery plot of grass, surrounded with woods, we lodge
this night in tents. Here I took leave of Count <i>Tomáso</i>, who then
presented me with two other books from <i>Constantinus Stolnichus</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> x.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">General</span> <i>Glychensberg</i>, who waited on his Excellency to this
place from <i>Cronstadt</i>, now returned thither. We proceed thro a
troublesome way and dark wood to <i>Sharkan</i>, which at length we
find deliciously situated upon a river, which a little way from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
hence enters the <i>Aluta</i>, now called <i>Alt</i>. Here I lodged at the house
of the minister, who was a Lutheran, by name <i>George Sularius</i>;
and, it being Sunday, I attended him to their evening service.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> xi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> set forward thro a fair, rich, and well cultivated country
to <i>Fogeras</i>, a large but scattered town, and there take up our station
by eleven a clock. His Excellency was here lodged in an
house, which belonged to Count <i>Tekely</i>, who was prime minister
to the late prince <i>Abaffi</i>, and slain in the defeat of General
<i>Heusler</i> near <i>Cronstadt</i>. I had here some conversation with the chief
pastor of the place, <i>Michael Rozgoni</i>, a learned Calvinist, who had
studied in Holland. At <i>Fogeras</i> is a castle surrounded with a wide
mote, and so strong, or at least so fortunate, that it is said never
to have been taken by force of arms.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> xii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">From</span> hence we proceed in six hours to <i>Úcha</i>, a village inhabited
intirely by Valachs. And setting out early from thence the
next morning, by twelve a clock we reach <i>Porumback</i>, a most delightful
village, situated very near the banks of the <i>Aluta</i>; which
river attended us for these three last days journey, not far from
our right hand, under the adjoining hills. His Excellency was
here met and complimented by general <i>Rabutin</i> from <i>Hermanstadt</i>,
who came accompanied with Count <i>Seau</i>, the Emperor’s chief
commissary in Transylvania, and two other officers of the imperial
army. The General returned before diner, and left my Lord
well accommodated in a pleasant country house of Prince
<i>Abaffi</i>; whose barnes, and magazines of grain, with the adjoining
fish ponds, and rich meadows, that surround the farm, we
viewed this afternoon with great pleasure.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> xiv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> leave <i>Porumback</i>, and are presently after upon the banks of
the <i>Aluta</i>, over which river his Excellency’s whole baggage, with the
horses, coaches, waggons, and other necessaries, were transported
upon flat bottomed boats. We proceed one Hungarian mile from
our <i>conáck</i>, and then his Excellency is again met by general <i>Rabutin</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
and several officers of the army, together with a train of
five hundred persons, consisting of two troops of horse with the
magistrates and chief citizens of <i>Hermanstadt</i>. After mutual compliments,
my Lord takes his place in the General’s coach, and so
they both ride together another Hungarian mile to <i>Hermanstadt</i>,
attended with a numerous retinue of guards and citizens into the
town, where the canons continually kept firing, and the inhabitants
received them in arms. There his Excellency being first
lodged in a large and convenient house in the marketplace, very
near the palace of the General, about one a clock was conduced
thither to diner, where a sumptuous feast was prepared at two
tables. At the first sat his Excellency with his retinue, general
<i>Rabutin</i>, his Lady, the Princess of <i>Holstein</i>, with the Countesses
<i>Seau</i>, <i>Bethlen</i>, <i>Mikes</i>, and some others; as also the Counts <i>Seau</i>,
<i>Bethlen</i>, <i>Mikes</i>, <i>Stanville</i> of Lorrain, <i>Costa</i> of Piedmont, <i>Monticelli</i>,
and Commissary <i>Belli</i>. After diner his Excellency returned
to his lodging, where he was now attended by Count <i>Bethlen</i>,
instead of Count <i>Mikes</i>, who was appointed to conduct him from
<i>Hermanstadt</i> as far as <i>Clausenburg</i>. In the evening the General
complimented his Excellency with the command of the garrison,
during his stay in this place; and thereupon pressed him four different
times to give the watch word, which nevertheless he
peremptorily declined.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> xv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">His</span> Excellency staid this and the following day at <i>Hermanstadt</i>,
together with his retinue; where he continued to be treated in
the same gentile manner by the General.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> xvii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> being Sunday, we had divine service and a sermon at his
Excellency’s lodgings, and then dined again with the General.
And in the evening I was favoured by my landlord, Mr. <i>George
Reisner</i>, senator of the city (an ingenious and learned person, who
had studied ten years in Holland) with his coach and company to
visit his garden, beyond the walls and mote of the city; near to
which adjoins a famous large and intire crucifix cut in stone,
much adored by the papists of this country. The same gentleman
gave me notice of three Roman inscriptions which, as I was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
informed, had been brought from <i>Ulpia Trajana</i>. The first was
upon a stone coffin in the market place, of which the following

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> same gentleman shewed me also the cathedral church of
this place, entertained me with the music of the organ, and presented
me with a book called <i>Breviculus de nationibus Transylvanicis</i>.
Another on the same subject was given me the day
before by the <i>rector scholae Cibiniensis</i>, which place with the
adjoining library I then visited. This night I likewise returned a
visit to the reverend <i>Isaacus Zabanius, primarius pastor Cibiniensis,
et ecclesiae cathedralis decanus</i>, by whom and his wife I was
kindly entertained above three hours. He then gave me an Answer,
which he had formerly compiled, to <i>Campiani Rationes decem</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> xviii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> six this morning his Excellency and retinue leaving <i>Hermanstadt</i>
were attended by the General, and gentlemen above mentioned,
beyond the adjoining river, after which they all took a cordial
leave; especially lieutenant colonel <i>Graven</i>, to whom his Excellency<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
presented a diamond ring. We now proceed in our way,
at which time I received an obliging letter from Mr. Dunster,
with an account of my successor’s arrival at <i>Smyrna</i> upon the
seventeenth of <i>April</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Hermanstadt</span> is a fair city, consisting of well proportioned
houses, regularly plaistered and covered with brick; and is incompassed
with an intire brick wall, and that again with the water
either of a mote, or river, which surrounds it. Over the gate, by
which we entered, is the statue of <i>Hermannus</i>, the founder of the
place. It is designed to be yet farther fortified by the Germans;
for which end they are now marking out the place of a citadel,
which they propose to build so strong and regular, as thereby to
curb not only this city, but the whole province. It is intirely inhabited
by Saxons, and consequently by professors of the Lutheran
or Augustan confession. They have here three churches, of which
the cathedral is large and well adorned. The General, and German
garrison, which now consists of twelve hundred men, as likewise
a few other papists, are fain to be contented with a private
chapel. General <i>Rabutin</i> is a comely, courteous, and facetious
gentleman, of severe discipline, and prudent management of the
Imperial soldiery, which thro this whole province, to the number
of about ten thousand men, is committed to his charge. He is
of French extraction, and was forced to fly while young, on account
of a duel, from his native country to the court of <i>Vienna</i>;
where after long service he at length obtained favour of the Princess
of <i>Holstein</i> then wife to Chancellor <i>Sinsendorff</i>; who after that
minister’s death condescended to marry him, and so raised him to
his present pitch of fortune. The civil government is in the hands
of the <i>Judex Cibiniensis</i>, whose jurisdiction reaches not only over
this city, but even the whole Saxon district. Next to him is the
<i>Consul Cibiniensis</i>, whose government is confined within the city.
And besides these there is a senate of about sixteen, and then a
commonalty of about an hundred men. The place in Latin is
called <i>Cibinium</i>, from the adjoining river <i>Cibin</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Before</span> eleven a clock we again take up our quarters at <i>Visakna</i>,
that is, <i>Saltzburg</i>, so called from the <i>salt mines</i>; which I
visited this afternoon, in company with the minister of the place,
<i>Joannes Nagy Borosnyai</i> of the Helvetian confession. The salt is
here dug, and cut into stones (as they call them) of a square figure,
and about an hundred pound in weight. Being so prepared in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
the cavern, which at the bottom extends itself very wide in the
manner of a dome, they are drawn up by cables, of which
one winds round an adjoining machine drawn by four horses, and
the other unwinds at the same time. The pit itself is square, lined
within with planks, as far as the earthy soil reaches, and extending
afterwards to the depth of about an hundred yards. These
stones are afterwards laid up in magazines, to be transported
on occasion by the <i>Maros</i> into the <i>Danube</i>, and thence vended
into Turkey or Germany for the use of the Emperor, who is the
sole proprietor of all the natural mines, with which this province
abounds. The above mentioned minister here gave me some
<i>gemmae salis</i>, as pellucid as ordinary crystal. He is a man well
learned, and has traveled into many countries, particularly England.
At the same place I likewise received a present of some
<i>specimina metallica</i>, namely gold, cinnabar, antimony, and others;
which were sent me by a gentleman, named <i>Samuel Koloseri</i>, the
Emperor’s general inspector of the Transylvanian mines.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> xix.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> depart hence for <i>Tsanad</i> and arrive there before twelve a
clock; from whence his Excellency designing for <i>Enyed</i> by the
way of <i>Balasfalva</i>, Mr. Montague, Mr. <i>Gangain</i>, and myself
take this opportunity of steping out of the way to see <i>Alba Julia</i>,
or <i>Wissenburg</i>. We therefore hire a post calash by five a clock
in the afternoon, and it being distant three long Hungarian miles
in dirty way, we scarce arrive there by twelve at night, having
near the city crossed the <i>Maurusius</i> over a wooden bridge. In our
way thither we saw a gang of <i>Zingans</i>, or gypses, common in this
and the neighbouring provinces, as well as Turkey.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> xx.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">His</span> Excellency continued his journey this day to <i>Balasfalva</i>;
and in the morning we at <i>Abba Julia</i> wait on the governor, Count
<i>Banti</i>, a worthy and courteous protestant nobleman, but for many
years weakened and tormented with the colic. We were conducted
to him thro the room, where the <i>comitia totius Transylvaniae</i>
are now held; and where Count <i>Seau</i>, commissary for his
Imperial Majesty, solicites the states for raising of subsidies, and
proposes other orders to them from the court of <i>Vienna</i>. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
done, we visit likewise Count <i>Seau</i>; who was so complaisant as to
shew us the castle where he dwells, being a magnificent palace,
and lately the residence of the princes of Transylvania. At the
same time we viewed the large Calvinist church adjoining thereto,
which is a lofty and stately fabric, but has suffered much from
the Tartars, who defaced the fair monuments, and burnt the tower,
in the year sixteen hundred and fifty eight. It is now fortified
with a ditch and rampart, which is likewise usual all over Transylvania.
The above mentioned monuments are of <i>Joannes Corvinus</i>,
commonly called <i>Huniades</i>; of Queen <i>Isabella</i>, and her
son <i>Ladislaus</i>; of <i>Sigismund</i>, and <i>George Ragotzi</i>, together with
the famous <i>Gabriel Bethlen</i>. The same morning we paid a visit
to the bishop of the reformed church in Transylvania, who resides
here, and is likewise pastor of the place, by name <i>Stephanus Vespreni</i>.
He is an old man, seems decayed in his parts, and is
troubled with a palsy in his tongue. With him we saw the professor
of the <i>Schola Albensis</i>, which in the year sixteen hundred
seventy two was translated hither from <i>Patak</i> in Hungary. He is
a learned, curious, and laborious man, teaches divinity, natural
philosophy, the tongues, and mathematics; has traveled into England
and other countries, and is a great admirer of the English;
for which reason his study is full of our books, and he both writes,
and speaks, and even teaches our language once a week to his
scholars. His name is <i>Kaposi Samuel</i>, and was made <i>S. Theologiae
Doctor</i> by a <i>diploma</i> from the Prince of Orange. These visits
performed, we repair to Count <i>Banti’s</i> to diner, where we
were honoured with a splendid feast; the governor keeping his
chamber. There sat at table the Lady governess, who is of the
family of <i>Bethlen</i>, with Countess <i>Bethlen Samuel</i>, Count <i>Bethlen
Nicolas</i> chancellor of the states of Transylvania, Count <i>Apór</i> treasurer,
Count <i>Holler</i> president of the states (the two last papists) together
with Count <i>Telchi</i>, <i>Joannes Sacks</i> the <i>Judex regius Cibiniensis</i>,
with Count <i>Seau</i>, and some others. After diner we spent some
time with professor <i>Kaposi</i>, and at night supped with Count <i>Seau</i>.</p>

the school and college of this place, which is reputed the most
flourishing of those, that belong to the reformed Calvinist church
in Transylvania. It has three professors, one of philosophy, <i>Stephanus
Kolosvari</i>, who has traveled into England; another of divinity,
<i>Stephanus Engedi</i>, a learned man, who gave me a popish
book, concerning the Emperor’s treatment of the reformed churches
in Hungary; and a third of the Greek tongue, logic, and history,
<i>Fr. Pariz-Papa</i>, a physician, who presented me with some printed
tracts of his own, and a manuscript <i>Itinerary</i> of Dr. <i>Basire</i> prebendary
of Durham, left by him in <i>Alba Julia</i>, where he professed
divinity during the late usurpation in England.</p>

of the town, and treated him at diner; after which taking leave,
he presented him with a set of six fine coach horses. It is a fair
city with a broad and straight street; but still retains on the houses

since almost entirely consumed it. It is seated upon the first branch

have here established their principal seat. I conversed with
one of them, <i>Stephanus Stanizlo</i>, professor of philosophy, with
whom I visited their <i>plebanus</i>, or chief pastor, and saw their church
and college. I likewise visited the Calvinist pastor, as also their
church and college, where I saw <i>M. B. Nemethi</i> their professor
of philosophy, <i>Sam. Nemethi</i> the divinity professor being absent.
In several public places of the city I observed antient dates of time,
particularly over one of the gates, where the year was marked,
with these characters, <img src="images/date-1477.jpg" width="43" height="15" alt="" /> that is 1477; and over the Unitarian

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> xxix.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Two</span> more Hungarian miles thro the like way bring us to <i>Zilak</i>,

passed certain mountains very woody, but not exceeding high,
which part Transylvania from Hungary; after which we now enter
into those parts of Hungary, which lately gave part of his title
to the prince of Transylvania.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">May</span> xxxi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Passing</span> two Hungarian miles thro a country more open and
well improved, we arrive at <i>Somlyo</i>; in which there is an old palace,
once a seat of residence for the kings of Hungary. Here the guards
and commissary is again changed, <i>Franciscus Trantzeni</i>, an Hungarian
gentleman, now taking that charge. As we continued in
this town the following day, I had an opportunity of conversing
with the minister, whose name is <i>Zovány</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> i.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> set forward three Hungarian miles to <i>Margarita</i>, and in
the way cross the <i>Krasna</i>, near which are the limits that terminate
the parts of Hungary. The soil is here luxuriantly rich,
well varied with pasture and intervening woods, and everywhere
adorned with damask roses, growing wild on short shrubs. Part
of my time was here employed in discoursing with the minister,
<i>Johannes Banki</i>. But having now passed thro <i>Transylvania</i>, as
well as the parts of <i>Hungary</i> subject to the same government, it is
here proper to recollect some general observations relating to this
province.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Transylvania</span>, which for many years had been tributary to
the Turks, and consequently under the protection of that empire,
which still allowed them the choice and government of their own
princes, was in the year 1687, under the conduct of the Duke of
<i>Lorrain</i>, subjected to the arms of the Emperor; and thereupon by
capitulation they resigned themselves to the Germans, under whom
they have since continued, tho as yet the Emperor has assumed
no distinct title from thence. He has ordinarily in garrison here
about twelve regiments, which since the peace of <i>Carlowítz</i> serve
rather to curb the inhabitants, than to awe the neighbouring Turk.
To this end they are now preparing a strong citadel in <i>Hermanstadt</i>,
and designing others in proper places, on pretence of charges
due to these forts and the standing militia. The Emperor exacts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
yearly severe taxes, of which they generally complain, as being
four times more than was exacted by the Turk. For whereas
they then paid the yearly tribute and exaction of about two
hundred thousand <i>floreni Rhenenses</i>, there is this year particularly
demanded from them, in the present assembly of the government
at <i>Alba Julia</i>, the sum of one million forty thousand six hundred,
which is charged for the following particulars. The</p>

<p class="noindent">These subsidies are demanded at the assembly in the Emperor’s
name, by his commissary, Count <i>Seau</i>; and the care of levying
and raising it is incumbent on the governor, the chancellor, the
treasurers, the <i>assessores tabulae regiae</i>, with other officers and
members of the assembly. Thus the civil government of the province
is committed to the Transylvanian nobility, distinguished by
the officers abovementioned; but the military government is, in
the hands of General <i>Rabutin</i>, who holds the province to a rigid
and exact obedience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Transylvania</span> is in the hands of three distinct people. First
the <i>Szekeli</i>, which are otherwise corruptly wrote <i>Sciculi</i>, <i>Siculi</i>,
or <i>Scytuli</i><a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>. The second are the <i>Saxones</i>. And the third are the
<i>Hungari</i>. The first and third of these speak the same Hungarian
language, and are <i>Hunns</i> of the same original, only settled in this
country at different times. The <i>Saxons</i> speak intirely the German
Saxon language, from which nation they are a colony, and
settled here under <i>Geysa</i> the second King of Hungary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">They</span> have each of them their distinct laws, customs, and privileges,
and are severally divided after this manner. First the <i>Szekeli</i>
into seven <i>szeks</i>, namely: <i>Meros-szék</i>, <i>Udvarhel-szék</i>, <i>Harom-szék</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
<i>Kesdi Orba Sepsi-szék</i>, <i>Csik-szék</i>, <i>Gyorgy-szék</i>, and <i>Arangus-szék</i>.
Over each of these seats preside so many captains; and being a
warlike robust people, still retaining the ferity of the Scythians,
of which the whole body of the <i>Hunni</i> was at first a colony, they
have been always exempted from taxes and duties to the government,
except only the service of war upon occasion under their
respective captains. But of late the Emperor has persuaded them to
submit to the like taxes and duties, with all other his Transylvanian
subjects. On account of their not holding their lands of the government,
there is a peculiar custom obtaining among them, that
in defect of heirs their estate escheats not to the government, but
to the next neighbour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> <i>Saxons</i> have in like manner their seven seats alloted from
their first settlement, namely: <i>Szerdaky-szék</i>, <i>Szeben-szék</i>, <i>Brassoy-szék</i>,
<i>Medyes-szék</i>, <i>Segyvar-szék</i>, <i>Bestereze-szék</i>, and <i>Erdovidek-szék</i>.
Each of these seats have their capital city, called <i>Regia
et libera civitas</i>. Over this city, and the seat or district belonging
to it, presides a <i>judex regius</i>, called in their language,
<i>konings rickter</i>. But the authority and prerogative of the <i>Judex
Cibiniensis</i>, that is of <i>Hermanstadt</i>, extends itself over the several
Saxon seats; except that he of <i>Brassow</i> or <i>Cronstadt</i> pretends in
many cases an exemption, which has been allowed, because of its
too great distance from the tribunal of <i>Szeben</i>, or <i>Hermanstadt</i>.
Besides the authority of this judge, there is a subordinate government
in each city by a senate, which ordinarily consists of about
sixteen, and a centumvirate or commonalty, tho it seldom contains
a complete hundred. Each in their several districts have the <i>jus
gladii</i>, and all other prerogatives of an intire jurisdiction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> third and richer part of Transylvania, possessed by the
<i>Hungarians</i>, is supposed and called the seat of the only Transylvanian
nobility; and accordingly it is divided into seven <i>comitatus</i>,
or residences, of its several courts, namely: The <i>comitatus Huniadensis</i>,
<i>Albensis</i>, <i>Thordensis</i>, <i>Claudiopolitanus</i>, <i>Interior et Exterior
Zolnokiensis</i>, <i>Doboczensis</i>, and <i>Krasnaiensis</i>. Now each of
these counties has four <i>comites</i>, of which two are called <i>supremi</i>,
and two <i>inferiores</i>; in whose hands, together with other nobles under
them, remain the whole jurisdiction and possession of their
respective counties; the other inhabitants being not only tenants,
but subjects, as they call them, and in some manner slaves to their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
respective nobles, to whom they ordinarily owe the work of three,
and sometimes of more days in the week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Besides</span> these, the <i>Valachi</i> are every where in great numbers
intermixted among the Transylvanian nations, but have no
jurisdiction or dominion of their own; and therefore they remain
as nourishers of cattle, and in that service slaves and subjects to the
rest. And not only <i>Valachs</i><a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>, but likewise (tho in lesser numbers)
there are found up and down in Transylvania, Rascians, Muscovites,
Armenians, Jews, and others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Those</span> called the received religions in Transylvania, that is,
those who above the space of an age have obtained the protection
of their princes under oath, and of the Emperor under articles
upon their late subjection, are four; the Roman Catholic; the
Lutheran; the Calvinist, which is here called peculiarly the Reformed;
and the Unitarian. The first of these is more frequent
in <i>Szekulia</i>, but yet not so prevalent as to possess even a tenth part
of all Transylvania. The second, or Lutheran, is common to all the
Saxon nation in this province. The third flourishes in <i>Szekulia</i>,
and the <i>comitatus Hungarici</i>. The fourth prevails here and there
likewise in the same countries, but those who profess it are not so
numerous in either. However they have a flourishing college at
<i>Clausenberg</i>, together with a large church; tho neither for beauty,
nor the number of its communicants, equal to that of the Calvinist
confession. These several religions are well known, and
distinguished by their faith and principles, all over Europe. I shall
therefore only say this concerning the discipline of the three last,
that their several parishes collected into distinct dioceses are subject
to their respective seniors; and these seniors, in their order, are
likewise subject to a provincial bishop, who has his court, in which
he judges matrimonial and other spiritual causes, and has also the
sole power of ordaining, as likewise of calling and presiding over
their yearly synod. And to this synod there is adjoined a consistory,
which is in the nature of an upper house, and a council to
the bishop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> Lutheran churches are in many places splendid, adorned
with organs and pictures, and little differing from the form of our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
larger churches, except that the altar is immoveable, and built
of stone, and sometimes too profusely painted. Their worship
consists of forms of prayers, then hymns, after these lessons and
sermons, and lastly prayers and concluding hymns. The worship
of the Unitarians exactly corresponds with that of the Calvinists.
These latter have sermons twice a week, besides Sundays, as also
morning and evening service throughout the week, at which appear
large and devout congregations in many places. Their service
is a metre psalm, a prayer from the pulpit, and then concludes
with another psalm. They have a form of prayer, and an
injunction of their bishop to make use of no other; but the custom
of most ministers has introduced the use of their own premeditated
devotions, and accordingly the people begin to disesteem those,
who confine themselves to the form. The Lutherans, Calvinists,
and Unitarians live peaceably with one another; but are not admitted
to each others communion of Christ’s body, without a
special declaration of conformity. The Lutherans in some places
consecrate a wafer, and in other places leaven bread. They likewise
have auricular confession, but abuse it not, as the Papists.
Their main difference from the Calvinists consists in their avowed
corporeal ubiquitarian presence. Among other known tenets of
the Unitarians, by which they take away the force of the Christian
sacraments, tho they generally use infant baptism not to give
scandal to the Calvinists, yet they rather wish to delay it till the
age of twelve years or upwards, and often practice accordingly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">These</span> three protestant religions remain as yet in the undisturbed
profession of their faith. But upon several late encroachments
of the Jesuits, and other priests, in confidence of the popish
government, to which they are subject; upon the withdrawing of
the tithes usually paid to the protestant ministers from the salt
mines, and now given to popish monks; and lastly upon the care,
which is taken by the court of Vienna, to supply all offices of the
province with papist ministers: upon these several accounts, I say,
the whole reformed people of Transylvania, especially the Calvinists,
begin to be under great apprehensions, and from the governor
to the meanest gentleman, earnestly embraced this occasion of
recommending their cause to the good services of his Excellency at
the Imperial court; after which they implored the prayers and
good wishes of the church of England, and in many places took
a solemn melancholy leave of us, as if they were just entering upon
a martyrdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> religion of the Valachs, Muscovites, Armenians, Rascians,
and others, is that of their respective nations in their proper seats
and countries. And it may be farther noted in relation to the
religion of Transylvania, that as in Hungary, so here likewise, the
Jesuits, who were before excluded by a positive article, have now
an express liberty of entering and setling in this province. Nor
can I omit to remark the great and blameable facility both of the
Calvinists, and Lutherans, in matters of divorce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">After</span> the religion of Transylvania, the natural soil of the
country falls under consideration; which is luxuriantly rich, well
cultivated, full of inhabitants, and conveniently distinguished with
a sufficient quantity of wood, hills, and water. The surface of
the earth is almost every where black, without the least stone to be
observed in many places; and in several tracts so fertile, as not to
require the advantage of dung, except only some parts of <i>Siculia</i>
where it is used. Besides all kinds of grain, which grow on the
surface of the earth, within it abounds with veins of metals, minerals,
and fossils of all sorts, particularly of gold; so that, as I
was informed by the Emperor’s inspector of his mines, there was
last year dug here to the value of twenty five thousand <i>zechins</i>.
But among other fossils the native cinnabar is most rare, and the
quicksilver which is here found to perfection. Salt is dug in several
places, in the manner described above<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>; by which a large
revenue accrues to the Emperor, to whom the property of all
mines belongs. But in the mean time the people suffer in the price
of this commodity; for since their late subjection to the Emperor,
a stone of salt weighing about an hundred pounds can scarce be
bought for three florins, whereas heretofore three stones of salt
were sold for one florin. The money current in Transylvania is
that of the Emperor, the <i>quarts</i> of Poland, with some other coins.
The reports related by some, who were eye witnesses, concerning
diverse particles of gold found in the products of their vineyards,
both here and about the celebrated mountain of <i>Tokái</i>, are very
remarkable; of which I shall only mention these following. A
piece of gold is said to have grown to a vine, instead of the green
tendrel, by which it takes hold of the adjoining trees, or other
substance that supports it. Pure gold was found in a grape, instead
of its ordinary natural stone. Small gold drops were observed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
to adhere to the skin of a grape. And even an intire grape had
been seen to consist of a perfect coat of gold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">As</span> to the temper and disposition of the inhabitants, they appear
cordial and hospitable, drink almost continually, and eat plentifully,
are unpolite but importunate in their civility, and even the vulgar
sort usually speak Latin; they are of a robust constitution, and principally
the <i>Siculians</i>, who have likewise a fierce and stately mein.
Their habit is a short waistcoat made very close to the body<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>, and
sleeves with flaps to them, that come over the backs of their hands.
Their breeches are likewise close to their thighs, and from thence
continued down in the form of a stocking to their feet. But on
their legs they commonly wear yellow or red boots, to which are
constantly fixed spurs, often three inches long. Over their waistcoat,
when they go abroad, they throw a loose but short fur vest,
which is either embroidered, or adorned with silver loops, on each
side before. The habit of the women, who for the most part are
beautiful and courteous, is a close narrow bodice, and from thence
petticoats, as usual with us in England; but over their arms they
wear loose linen sleeves, resembling those of a bishop’s rochet.
Their head dress is low, and among those of the better sort richly
adorned with pretious stones; much resembling some old English
pictures, particularly those of <i>Henry</i> the eighth’s wives. They
likewise wear over their shoulders the same sort of fur vest, as the
men; but the inferior sort are usually drest, when abroad, in a long
and loose black mantle, reaching from their shoulders down to
the ground, and all round gathered into deep and numberless
folds, not unlike the gowns worn by the islanders in the <i>Archipelago</i>.
Maids likewise wear a black ring of velvet on their head,
which they call a crown, and resembles the figure of an hat without
brims. With regard to matrons, their law formerly admitted
no proof of adultery, unless under the eye witness of twenty four
persons at least; which in a virtuous age was an egregious testimony
to the chastity of their women, but in a vitious one must
needs prove too great an encouragment to that heinous sin. The
Hungarians and Siculians have an odd fashion of shaving their head
round the lower part, and leaving the hair at the top, which afterwards
they tie into a knot, and let it hang over one or other of
their temples. This custom they might possibly have received of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
old from the Sicambrians (who once built the city <i>Sicambria</i>, and
settled a colony there) since they were antiently famed for the like
manner of knotting of their hair<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>. We may further observe a
certain infelicity of Transylvania, as well as the adjoining parts
of Hungary, in persuading themselves at least, that they are infested
with witchcraft. For women of all ages are yearly executed
for that crime, and this commonly upon evidence of their having
threatned mischief to their neighbours, their children, goods,
cattle, or other effects, and some correspondent effect, which has
seemed afterwards to happen. In the Saxon seats of Transylvania
they often put them to that vulgar trial of water; and I have heard
it avowed by those, who have declared themselves to have been
eye witnesses, that some suspected persons could never sink below
the surface of the water, when others immediately subsided to the
bottom<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>. And in such cases the poor afflicted, tortured, and
now perhaps distracted person, confesses the indictment, and then
without the least repreive is committed to the faggot. But as ignorant
places have been always reputed most subject to witchcraft,
this very well suits the state of Transylvania; where every petty
district is the seat of its own judicature, and the power of life
and death is consequently lodged in illiterate and superstitious
persons.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> ii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> it is now time to proceed on our journey, in which one
Hungarian mile and a half carried us to <i>Szekhelyhíd</i>, where his
Excellency lodged in the house of a popish prelate, by name <i>Joannes
Smitz</i>, of the order of the <i>Praemonstratenses</i>, a gentile and
agreable person. In his parlour, where he had an altar and crucifix,
I observed over the former a profane picture of the <i>Holy
Trinity</i>, representing an <i>Old Man</i>, with his <i>Son</i> sitting betwixt his
legs, and at the son’s feet the <i>Holy Ghost</i> in the shape of a <i>dove</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> iii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Three</span> Hungarian miles and a half farther brought us this day
to <i>Debrecyn</i>, thro a rich soil, not destitute of wood, nor water;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
the latter of which is plentifully found in this countrey, as also in
Transylvania and Valachia, by reason of its frequent and extended
lakes; tho fountains are scarce any where to be observed. This
city has lately obtained the privilege of being <i>libera et regia</i> from
the Emperor, in consideration of its late grievous oppressions between
the Turkish and German forces; since which, like other
free cities, it is governed by its own judge, senate, and commonalty.
It is large and populous, and sets up for the bulwark of
the reformed church in Hungary; which character it maintains
by its large and well disciplined college of almost two hundred
students, under the care of two eminent professors; one of divinity,
named <i>Johannes Koes</i>, who is likewise bishop or superintendent
of the province; and the other of philosophy, whose name
is <i>Michael Vaári</i>. As this college is kept in good repair, so the
students are allowed their constant diet, and the professors receive
their salary, at the sole charge of the city. There are likewise two
spatious churches, served by three able and learned pastors, <i>Thomas
Veresedgyhazi</i>, <i>Michael Rapoti</i>, and <i>Stephanus Patai</i>. The
city is likewise furnished at the public charge with a capacious and
well stored dispensary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Before</span> his Excellency approached this place, he was complimented
by several messengers from the mayor, who commands the
militia here, then by the judge, senators, and others; and at length
by the bishop, professors, pastors, and scholars. With this retinue his
Excellency entered the city, which was orderly lined with arms
as far as his lodgings. These were appointed for him in the house
of one <i>Stephanus Dobozi</i>, a rich, generous, and learned gentleman;
who among other public designs is now undertaking to
print a new version of the Hungarian <i>Bible</i>, to be distributed
among the reformed Christians of that kingdom.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> iv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> being <i>Corpus Christi</i> day, his Excellency continued at
<i>Debrecyn</i>; at which time I took the opportunity of visiting the
bishop, professors, and pastors of the town, the first of whom
presented me with an handkerchief of the Hungarian fashion. I
was introduced to them by one <i>Paul Gyongyóssi</i>, who met us in
this place from a neighbouring cure. He had lately traveled into
England, and resided sometime in <i>Glocester Hall, Oxford</i>, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
he was known to my brother of dear memory. But in his return
home thro <i>Vienna</i> his books were seized, to the value of five hundred
florins, by Cardinal <i>Colonicza</i>, archbishop of <i>Strigonium</i>;
on which account he now solicited the favour and interest of his
Excellency. He presented me with the <i>Canones Ecclesiae Reformatae
Hungariae</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> v.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> morning the judge and magistrates of <i>Debrecyn</i> presented
his Excellency with a gentile sword, and two small vessels of
the best <i>Tokái</i> wine. And after traveling one Hungarian mile and
a half thro a dead extended plain, void of tree or shrub, we came
to <i>Ujvaros</i>. Here I first took notice of the Hungarian sheep, which
are distinguished from most others by their horns, which are long,
straight, and twisted; also by their wool, which is exceeding coarse.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> vi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Three</span> Hungarian miles thro the same level and naked plain
brought us this day to <i>Csege</i>, which is a pass over the <i>Tibiscus</i>. In
our way hither we had in view on the right hand, at the distance
of about five miles, the celebrated mountain of <i>Tokái</i>, in compass
about ten Hungarian miles, and renowned for its generous wines.
At the aforesaid <i>Csege</i> we ferry over the <i>Tibiscus</i> in two large flat
bottomed boats, thence we travel for some time with the river on
our right hand, and then strike into the plain to <i>Csat</i>, a large
village about one Hungarian mile from <i>Csege</i>, where we fix our
quarters.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> vii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">His</span> Excellency stayed this day at <i>Csat</i>, at which time I had
some conversation with the minister, <i>Stephanus Szirák</i>, formerly a
traveler in England. Here I took notice of the fair, white, and
stately cattle of Hungary; and walked in the feilds, to enjoy a more
distinct prospect of the mountain <i>Tokái</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> viii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> proceed one Hungarian mile and a half thro the same plain
to <i>Proszlo</i>, which is situated on a large and diffused lake, supplied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
by the <i>Tibiscus</i>, into which it empties itself. In our way hither,
we left at a near distance on our right hand the city <i>Agria</i>,
and the mountains denominated from thence.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> ix.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> move one Hungarian mile and a half forward in the
same plain, and at the same distance from the mountains of <i>Agria</i>,
to <i>Alány</i>. Before diner his Excellency with a retinue went an
English mile from hence, in order to visit a new country house and
garden belonging to the worthy General <i>Glychensberg</i>; who by
donation from the Emperor possesses great part of this village, as
likewise of that where we lodged last night. I had here an occasion
to observe the Hungarian houses under ground, having unawares
like to have dropt into a chimney. We took notice likewise
of a <i>plica Polonica</i> in the hair of his Excellency’s landlord;
who told us, that it being once cut off by his wife, he became
perfectly blind for three months, and did not recover his sight, till
the <i>plica</i> was grown out and formed again. The same thing is
common to most horses in this country.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> x.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">From</span> <i>Alány</i> we go on this day two Hungarian miles to
<i>Arokszalles</i>, thro the same plain, the soil of which is as black as
coal, and in most places overrun with weeds and marshes for want
of tillage. In the midway we cross the small river <i>Both</i>, by which
is a posthouse of the same name. <i>Arokszalles</i> is a popish village,
the first of that sort we had seen in Hungary. It belongs to the
Prince of <i>Newburg</i>, Grand Master of the <i>Teutonic</i> order, who has
bought lately of the Emperor a large compass of ground on both
sides the <i>Tibiscus</i> for a million of florins. From our quarters we
have in view to the right of our road, at the foot of a pleasant
tract of mountains, the city <i>Gyongyossi</i>, lately taken from the
Protestants (as they told us at <i>Debrecyn</i>) by the injuries of the Jesuits
and other Romanists.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> xi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> continue our journey one Hungarian mile to <i>Hatwan</i>, thro
the same plain, along the foss of an antient <i>Roman</i> camp. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
hills of <i>Gyongyóssi</i> are still at a near distance on our right hand,
in which four Hungarian miles from <i>Arokszalles</i> is the famous gold
mine of <i>Kremnytz</i>, with others of silver, iron, and other minerals,
in the same neighbourhood. <i>Hatwan</i> was lately a walled
city, and is now inhabited by Romanists, being the property of the
Prince of <i>Solmes</i>, grand master to the King of the <i>Romans</i>. The
Emperor constantly employs five hundred labourers in the mines
of <i>Kremnytz</i>, tho of late years they are said to fail. At <i>Hatwan</i>,
as in all Hungary, I observed the method of burying their
corn in holes under ground, as <i>Hirtius</i> remarks of the Africans<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> xii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">At</span> <i>Hatwan</i> we immediately cross the small river <i>Zagywa</i>, and
thence proceed one Hungarian mile and half thro a pleasant variety
of woods and pastures, valleys and hills, to <i>Kerepes</i>; where
at a neat German house his Excellency staid to breakfast, and
then went forward the same length of way thro a naked, tho not
so level a plain, to <i>Pest</i>. At his entry here he is saluted by the
canon from the opposite castle of <i>Buda</i>, and lodged at the <i>Fountain</i>
inne. <i>Pest</i> is now a small but compact city, intirely built
out of the ruins, to which it was reduced by the two late sieges of
<i>Buda</i>. Its antient wall, with the battlements and bastions, is still
intire, and incloses it in the figure of an half moon, terminating
on the banks of the <i>Danube</i>, which completes the remaining
circuit of the city. There are still extant three or four <i>minarées</i>
of Turkish <i>mosques</i>, now devoted to Christian use. But what gives
just offence both to Turks and Christians is a new pillar, erected
in the market place, and bearing on its top a large stone sculpture
of the <i>Trinity</i>; a figure as common, as it is scandalous, in
Germany.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> xiii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day his Excellency remained here, which gave Mr. Paget
and myself an opportunity of passing over to <i>Buda</i> on a flying
bridge, which is maintained by the city <i>Pest</i>. The famous city
of <i>Buda</i> is the capital of Hungary, and was the seat of its Kings
till the year fifteen hundred twenty nine, when by treachery it fell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
into the hands of <i>Solymán</i> the <i>Great</i>; since which it was several
times attempted by the Christian arms, but never successfully,
till the year sixteen hundred sixty eight. And it yet remains in
the same condition, in which that terrible siege had left it, with
regard to its fortifications; but the private houses, especially those
of the <i>Rascian</i> and <i>Water Town</i>, are again handsomely rebuilt.
That, which is called the <i>Upper Town</i>, is likewise begining to be
reinhabited, but not equally with the other two. The situation
of the whole city lies in the following manner. From the banks
of the <i>Danube</i>, which here runs N. W. and S. E. there arises a steep
and oblong hill, the length of about half a mile, and the hight
of about two hundred paces, on which stands, what is called the
<i>Upper Town</i>. This on the N. W. end has that famous castle, which
was the palace of the Hungarian Kings; and from thence the walls
and other fortifications are continued round the town. On both
ends of the hill are two small valleys, each of which has a large
suburb; that on the N. W. end called the <i>Rascian</i>, and that on the
S. E the <i>Water Town</i>. The latter of these is larger, and much
better built; and extends itself not only in the valley above mentioned,
but likewise betwixt the <i>Danube</i> and a great part of the
hill, on which the wall and <i>Upper Town</i> is built. Just beyond
the <i>Rascian Town</i> is a steep and sharp rocky hill, which in case
of a siege must needs annoy the castle; and along the backside of
the city wall is extended, at a nearer distance, another rising
ground, which must likewise gall that side of the fortification.
These therefore the Imperialists must possess with proper forts,
whenever they undertake to repair the wall and castle of <i>Buda</i>;
the present remains of which were shewn us this morning by the
lieutenant of the ordnance, the most remarkable whereof were
these which follow. The hall of the royal palace, in which the
carved windows, chimney pieces, and other decorations, shewed
the work of an excellent hand; and were embelished, among other
devises, with the arms of <i>Matthias Corvinus</i>. The several canons,
mortar pieces, bombs, and other artillery, which make the present
ammunition of the castle. The two breaches, one entered
by the Bavarians, and the other by the Imperialists, when they took
the place. The wooden gate, hewn at the bottom by the Imperialists,
which action gave the last rout to the Turks. The stone
arched chamber, which they maintained to the last; tho the Bavarians
had been many days lodged in the next adjoining apartment,
and nothing but a single wall remained betwixt the two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
enemies. The well and capacious cistern, sufficient to afford water
for that numerous Turkish garrison, which at first consisted of
twenty four thousand men. What else occurs observable in this
place, is first the prospect, which we took from the <i>Water Town</i>
of old <i>Buda</i>, or <i>Sicambria</i> of the Romans, about an English mile
from hence, up the stream of the river. And secondly, the famous
sulphureous baths, exactly opposite to the city <i>Pest</i>, which
are supplied by a plentiful hot fountain, that runs from the steep
rocky hill before mentioned in the neighbourhood of the <i>Rascian
Town</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">At</span> midday we were invited to diner by the administrator, or
chief civil magistrate of the place. By his office he is president
of the <i>camera Budensis</i>, which consists of twelve officers, and enjoys
great revenues, as well as an entire jurisdiction for many miles
round the city. His Imperial Majesty has about fourteen hundred
men in Garrison at <i>Buda</i> and <i>Pest</i>, under General <i>Pefferhoft</i>,
who was now gone to demolish the fortifications of <i>Erla</i>; it being
the Emperor’s design to divest this country of all its lesser
forts, which at this juncture might be a refuge to any rebellious
subjects. The whole country of Hungary to this place is a black
and rich soil, without one stone to be observed, except in towns;
and abounds with lakes. The wine of <i>Buda</i> exactly resembles that
of <i>Bourdeaux</i>, and for these two last years, by an agent of the
Earl of <i>Nottingham</i>, has began to be imported into England, by
the way of <i>Breslaw</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> xiv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Early</span> this morning we depart from <i>Buda</i>, when his Excellency
was again saluted by the guns of the castle. Three Hungarian
miles thro a rich, woody, and well watered country bring us to
<i>Biéske</i>; a village where the Protestant are most numerous, but
were nevertheless deprived of the parish church last year by the
Romanists.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> xv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Three</span> more Hungarian miles carry us this day to <i>Koes</i>, thro
a continued wood, wherein are observable many curious trees,
herbs, and flowers, particularly the <i>fraxinella</i>; to say nothing of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
the damask roses, hyacinths, <i>barbaréae</i>, <i>lilia convallium</i>, and some
others, obvious in our whole road thro Hungary.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> xvi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">From</span> <i>Koes</i>, where his Excellency lodged the last night, in an
house of Count <i>Estzerhazi</i>, Palatin of Hungary, it is one Hungarian
mile to <i>Igmand</i>, at which we arrive by eight a clock this
morning. And one mile from thence toward the right hand we
stop to see the city and fort of <i>Komora</i>. In a post calash we arrive
on the banks of the <i>Danube</i> by ten a clock, and passing over
in a boat enter the city, which is seated on the point of the island
<i>Schut</i>, where it is washed on one side by the <i>Danube</i> itself; and
on the other by that branch of it, which takes the name of <i>Wag</i>,
from that river falling into it not far above the city <i>Komora</i>. The
extreme point of this island is possessed by the castle and fort,
consisting of four bastions, and an angle at the farther end, which
represents the figure of a tortoise. Before the gate and drawbridge
there is a place of arms, and before that another strait fortification
with two bastions and an half moon, added by the
present Emperor. This was the last bulwark against the Turks,
before the success of the last war, and is called the <i>Virgin Fort</i>,
in token of its having never been taken by the enemy. To perpetuate
the memory of this, the statue of a virgin is erected in one
angle of that bastion, which is on the left hand at the entrance of
the place. After this view of the castle we content ourselves
with a slighter view of the town, which appears neat and compact;
and by two a clock return to his Excellency’s quarters at
<i>Igmand</i>, the whole way lying over a green, naked, and level plain.
In the castle of <i>Komora</i> I found the three following inscriptions,
two of them in Latin, and the third in Greek, which are cut
upon stone coffins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Our</span> next stage, which was three Hungarian miles, brought us
from <i>Igmand</i> to <i>Rab</i>, thro a level country, and well cultivated.
Half an hour before we enter the town, his Excellency is met by
a troop of <i>Hussars</i> well mounted, and each man carrying a small
flag in his hand. <i>Rab</i>, which is the proper government of the
Prince of <i>Baden</i>, is pleasantly seated at the confluence of the rivers
<i>Rab</i> and <i>Rabnitz</i>, which unite near the walls of the castle, and
then in one stream immediately fall into the <i>Danube</i>. The castle
is large, and well fortified with seven bastions, four cavaliers, and
proportionable outworks. It contains within an ample space of
ground, possessed with houses, and divided into streets, which
make the best part of the city, the rest being more scattered and
diffused on both sides of the <i>Rabnitz</i>. It is now about a century,
since this place was taken from the Turks by a stratagem of Count
<i>Schaurtzenburg</i>, who applying a petard to one of the gates in the
night, at one stroke blew open the great iron door, which flew
many paces within the town, and is now kept as a memorial of the
fact in the cathedral church. The Turks marched in the sight of
this garrison to the siege of <i>Vienna</i>, and received several shot from
thence; and at their return, had the Imperialists of this place
known their defeat, they might have intercepted their passage,
by cutting down the bridges of the <i>Rab</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> xviii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">His</span> Excellency staying this day at <i>Rab</i>, I took the opportunity
of visiting <i>Stephanus Morsai</i>, the reformed minister of the
place. And about ten a clock Mr. Stepney, her Majesty’s Envoy
Extraordinary at <i>Vienna</i>, with the young Earl of Bridgwater, and
his brother Mr. Egerton, came to <i>Rab</i> to meet my Lord Paget,
and welcome him into these parts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> xix.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day, thro frequent villages and fruitful feilds, we continue
our journey two Hungarian miles to <i>Hungrisch Altenburg</i>, a
small town with fair buildings, enclosed with a wall, and seated
on the river <i>Leyta</i>, which at the distance of half a mile falls into
the <i>Danube</i>. Here Mr. Stepney, my Lord Paget, and some others
proceed directly to <i>Vienna</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> xx.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Three</span> Hungarian miles, thro a delicious and well tilled country,
in sight of <i>Presburg</i> castle, we proceed to <i>Pruck</i>; just at the
entrance of which we cross the <i>Leyta</i>, and by that means pass out
of <i>Hungary</i> into <i>Austria</i>, of which <i>Pruck</i> is the first town in this
road. It is a considerable compact place, neatly built with an appearing
magnificence, which they affect by building their houses
high and uniform towards the street. It has a castle and a strong
wall, tho not sufficient against the present art of war. In the market
place is a pillar, that bears a profane image of the <i>Trinity</i>, the
<i>Father</i> in the figure of an old man, the <i>Son</i> standing at his right
hand, and the <i>Holy Ghost</i> in the shape of a <i>dove</i> hovering betwixt
their heads. Here is an handsome convent of Augustin friars, and
in the market place a new church not yet finished, which promises
something both beautiful and magnificent.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> xxi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day, being Sunday, we continue at <i>Pruck</i>, when I took
an occasion of walking by the banks of the <i>Leyta</i>, in pleasant
and delightful meadows.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> xxii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Four</span> German miles from hence bring us to <i>Schweka</i>, a neat
village near <i>Eberstorff</i>; where is a palace of the Emperor, and a
large park, enclosed by the <i>Danube</i> and the <i>Schweka</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">June</span> xxiii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> three in the afternoon his Excellency moves from hence,
and in an hour and a half, at the distance of two German miles,
happily arrives at <i>Vienna</i>; where he is lodged in the suburbs, betwixt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
the <i>Caristhian</i> gate and the <i>Favorita</i>, in a palace of Count
<i>Sterembergh</i>. After the repose of a day or two his Excellency
had a separate audience of the Emperor, and Empress, the Archduke
<i>Carlo</i>, and the four Archdutchesses. And being visited by most
of the nobility, courtiers, and ministers of the place, he afterwards
took occasion of returning their respective visits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Vienna</span> is seated on a point of land, made by the confluence
of the river <i>Wien</i> and a branch of the <i>Danube</i>, which latter here
enlarges itself about a thousand paces from its main chanel. The
city is of a moderate circumference, scarce containing more than
four thousand paces within the circuit of the walls; but round
these, at a large distance, are extended many diffused suburbs, by
means of which it may be placed among the larger cities of Europe.
The fortifications are effective, regular, and intire; a large uninterrupted
glacis, a strong pale, a deep and wide foss, a substantial
curtain lined with brick, thirteen bastions, and as many ravelins,
with six well defended gates. Answerable to these there are two
arsenals within the city; one for ammunition and artillery belonging
to the Emperor, and the other for small arms belonging
to the citizens. The streets, tho few of them broad, are yet all
of them fair and moderately straight, ranged on each side with
lofty houses of four or five stories high, built with a good appearance,
tho not really magnificent; for they shew a regularity of
architecture in their windows, cornishes, and water tables, but the
materials are only brick walls incrusted in imitation of freestone.
Among the buildings of the city are interspersed several oblong
piazzas, adorned with fountains, tho of no great art or curiosity.
Yet there are two squares, each of which exhibits a considerable
public monument; one being the pillar of the <i>Blessed Virgin</i>,
and the other that of the most <i>Holy Trinity</i>. The former of these
is a brass column, adorned round the four corners of the basis with
as many figures of angels, and on the chapiter bearing a noble
statue of the <i>Madonna</i>, with her feet resting on a dragon. It was
begun by the last Emperor, and finished by the present; and exhibits
four religious or superstitious inscriptions, the chief of which
is a triumphant declaration of the immaculate conception, as now
confirmed by a papal verdict, and hence forward to be received as
an article of faith. The latter pillar, called that of the <i>Holy Trinity</i>,
is a magnificent column of marble and freestone rising sixty
six feet high, almost in the form of a pyramid. It was the work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
of ten years, finished in 1692, at the expence of a hundred thousand
florins, and erected by the present Emperor in commemoration
of this city, and the dukedom of <i>Austria</i>, being delivered
from the plague in the year 1679. It is adorned in three corners
with these inscriptions, <i>Deo Patri Creatori</i>, <i>Deo Filio Redemptori</i>,
<i>Deo Spiritui Sanctificatori</i>; and in three other places with larger
devotions and dedications, composed by his Imperial Majesty. From
the basis it rises in continual orbs and protuberances of clouds,
surrounded with several intire angelic figures, out of which are
seen the wings and heads of others. But on the top is represented
in gilt brass the <i>Most Holy Trinity</i>: the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, as a <i>dove</i>,
irradiated; the <i>Son</i> in an human figure, holding a cross; and the
<i>Father</i> at his left hand, with no marks of majesty, but clothed in a
loose gown, like an old man, bearing a globe in his right hand. At
the bottom is the Emperor himself, kneeling indeed in a posture of
devotion, but otherwise represented with more marks of honour and
majesty, than the <i>Divine Being</i> which he adores. The figure of <i>God
the Father</i> is very frequent in Austria, and variously expressed, some
times in a nightgown and cap, and at other times with a papal crown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> cathedral church of this place is dedicated to <i>St. Stephen</i>,
and is a stately antient building, having an high tower adorned
throughout with crotchets so strong, that it withstood several canon
shot in the late siege. It is now repaired, and bears in the work
the date of that year, which was 1683. On the spire it has a cross
rising from between the wings of the <i>Roman eagle</i>, instead of the
<i>half moon</i>, which stood there before by compact with <i>Solymán</i> the
<i>Magnificent</i>. The inside of the church is divided into three isles,
at the upper end of which are many magnificent altars, with at
least thirty more dispersed about the pillars and other corners of the
church. Near the principal of these the walls are almost covered
with pictures and sculpture, superstitiously dedicated on occasion
of so many vows there made; which I call therefore, in the words
of that ingenious heathen poet, <i>Tabulis sacer votivis paries</i>. Over
the great altar is placed the picture of the Madonna, by the name
of <i>Sta. Maria de Boes</i>, brought not long since from Hungary on
occasion of its having shed tears; of which, I saw one at <i>Sancta
Margarita</i>, who pretended to be an eye witness. The anniversary
of the day it was brought to <i>Vienna</i>, and of that, on which it
wept, are celebrated by a public feast, when the Emperor likewise
hears mass on the occasion. There is likewise another miraculous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
image of the <i>Virgin</i> at the lower north door of the cathedral,
which is daily so thronged with worshipers on their knees, that
it gives offence to the bishop of this city, who is endeavouring to
suppress the picture, as well as the abuse. In this door is a white
stone, worn considerably by the touch of all that enter there, as
being thought to be one of those, with which <i>St. Stephen</i> was martyred.
Round the body of the church are frequent monuments
well carved, and some sculptures of the <i>History of the Gospel</i>,
which can scarce any where be exceeded. There is likewise a new
saint, whose statue of stone has been lately erected on all the bridges
of <i>Vienna</i>. He is styled under his picture, <i>S. Joannes Mepomienus,
Martyr</i>, who was drowned by a King of Bohemia for not
discovering a confession of the Queen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Besides</span> this cathedral there are four or five parochial churches,
of which the most remarkable is that of <i>St. Michael</i>; but among
such a multitude of conventual churches, and each of these furnished
with a large number of altars, the parochial are in a great
measure obscured. The most splendid convents of the place are
first, that of the Dominicans; after this the Benedictines, formerly
belonging to the <i>Scotch</i>; then two belonging to the Jesuits, of
which one is called the <i>Domus professa</i>, the other the <i>college</i>; next
the Minorite Franciscans, then the Angustines, and lastly the Capuchines.
Of these the Minorite Franciscans have in their chapel
a pattern of the <i>Scala sancta</i>; the Augustines the <i>Capella aulica</i>,
and the pattern of the <i>Temple of Loretto</i>; the Capuchines a small
but pretty chapel in one side of their church, wherein are buried
the deceased of the Imperial family. The roof of the church belonging
to the college of Jesuits is now newly painted in perspective,
that is inimitable, by <i>P. Pozzo</i> of that society; who likewise
did the celebrated perspective in the church of that society
at <i>Rome</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Vienna</span> was made the seat of the Imperial family by <i>Ferdinand</i>
the second, who translated it from <i>Gratz</i>. The imperial
and royal palaces belonging to this place are, one old one in the
city, usually called the <i>Bourg</i>; another in the suburb opposite to
the Corinthian gate, called the Favorite; a third at <i>Eberstorff</i>,
two hours distant from the city; and a fourth at <i>Luxemburg</i>, at the
distance of two hours and a half. All these are plain, but capacious
and convenient buildings; and the Emperor divides his residence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
betwixt them, according to the different seasons of the
year. But at <i>Schonbran</i>, about two English miles distant from
<i>Vienna</i>, is a new palace as yet in some measure unfinished; which
is built for the King of the <i>Romans</i> after the Italian mode, adorned
in the pinacles with statues, a gentle ascent and spatious stairs up
to the entrance, beautified with a regular garden behind, and on
the front two ranges of stables and offices, that form a regular
square court. The rooms and apartments within are stately and
well proportioned, and the doors and chimney pieces richly built
with Polonian marble. Besides these, in the way to <i>Eberstorff</i> are
to be seen the stately remains of the palace, called <i>Neugebac</i>; which
was destroyed by the Turks in the late siege, and is not yet repaired.
However there appears a regular front, consisting of proper
pillars; and in some apartments of this ruined house are kept
several wild beasts of great curiosity. These, with some others at
<i>Schonbran</i>, I took an opportunity of viewing, and shall here give
a brief account of them. At <i>Neugebac</i> are two <i>lions</i>, one of which
is about five years old, but the most stately and majestic as can
well be seen. Three <i>cassawares</i>, a species of bird without wings,
the body of the size and shape of a sheep, the legs long and thick
in proportion, the neck tall with a blue but blunt crest, the feathers
black and exactly resembling those of an ostrich. Three
<i>tigers</i>, one of a large and unusual size. Two <i>leopards</i> well spotted,
their ears short, their head like that of a cat, but their body
more approaching to a mongrel greyhound; they are swift, and
hunt hares, or other creatures, which are thrown into their walk.
Several <i>lynces</i>, nothing different (as I am informed) from the panther;
they are spotted with larger circles than a tiger or leopard,
and much resemble a wild cat, but exceed it in size. An <i>hyaena</i>,
much resembling a mastif, but the nose more round and contracted,
a large belly, and a brindled spotted skin. A <i>beaver</i>, which
is a little amphibious animal, of a flat figure, with a short neck and
legs, a soft and thick fur, and a bare tail. These which follow,
are at <i>Schonbran</i>. Several <i>wild goats</i>, the males with large horns,
and therefore by the antients called <i>aegoceros</i>. Two <i>ostriches</i>, the
one five, the other fifteen years old, the head higher than the ordinary
stature of a man, the feathers black, except on the tail
and tip of the wings, where they are milk white, the thighs perfectly
bare, the legs long and substantial, the feet divided into two
broad pulpy claws, which are thought poisonous, and in figure
somewhat resembling those of a camel, whence they are called in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
Latin <i>camelostruthi</i>. Two <i>antilopes</i>. A she <i>elk</i>, a timerous animal,
which is made much like an hind, with a broad excrescent mouth.
Three <i>uri</i>, in the figure of a bull, but a thicker and shorter neck,
with the appearance of prodigious strength, and one of them, very
large. But concerning these two last species a fuller account
may be seen in <i>Caesar</i>, <i>De B. Gall.</i> <i>Lib.</i> vi. <i>cap.</i> 5.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">There</span> are three libraries in this place. One is called <i>Bibliotheca
Windhagiana</i>, which belongs to the Dominican convent.
Another is at the college of Jesuits, which is larger and better collected.
But the third, which exceeds them both, and perhaps all
others in these parts of the world, is that, which belongs to the
Emperor at his palace in this city. In the Dominican library I
saw a monstrous human <i>foetus</i> kept in spirits of wine; with another
dried and stuffed, which is double in all its parts, as having two
heads, four hands, four legs, and two trunks as far as the navel,
where they unite into one body. But what I observed in the <i>Caesarian</i>
library will deserve a more distinct relation, which I shall
give in the following particulars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> most eminent <i>Greek Mss.</i> in the <i>Catalogue</i> of <i>Nesselius</i>, with
other curiosities by him mentioned, and particularly the pictures
belonging to the <i>res vestiaria</i> of the antients; all which may be
seen in the catalogue which I had there with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Besides</span> what occurs in the <i>Nesselian Catalogue</i>, the antient
<i>Ambrosian Ms.</i> of part of <i>Livy</i>, which is clear and legible; tho the
contrary is asserted by Dr. <i>Brown</i><a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>. It is the oldest copy now extant
of that author, and tho it ends with <i>Lib.</i> <span class="allsmcap">XLV</span>; yet there is added at
the bottom of the page, <i>Liber</i> <span class="allsmcap">XLVI</span> <i>incipit feliciter</i>, as if it was extant
at that time, which is conceived by <i>Lambecius</i> to be about a
thousand years since.</p>

<p>The <i>Ms. German Bible</i> of the Emperor <i>Wenceslaus</i>, in the
margin of which, among other curious pictures relating to the
sacred story, he is himself painted in more than fifty places, as
washing in his <i>bagnio</i>, where he was once prisoner; together with
the <i>bagnio</i> girl, who furthered his escape, and whom afterwards
he so passionately loved.</p>

<p>A copy of the <i>golden bull</i>, containing the constitutions of the
empire by <i>Charles</i> the fourth, in the first year of his empire. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
is now a great curiosity, and was written for the use of the Emperor
<i>Wenceslaus</i>, but forty years after the original published at
<i>Waremburg</i> in 1356, and still reserved at <i>Augsburg</i>.</p>

<p>An elegant, tho not very antient <i>Ms.</i> of <i>Cicero’s Orations</i>, with
another more antient of <i>Ovid’s Metamorphoses</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Letter</i> of the present <i>Tartar Han</i> to the present Emperor,
finely wrote on a long roll of silk.</p>

<p>A printed book of the <i>Confucian philosophy</i> in the <i>Sinese</i> character
and language, published by the Jesuits.</p>

<p>A <i>Ms.</i> book of <i>Latin letters</i>, written by the present Emperor
to <i>Lambecius</i>, in a neat and elegant stile; in which he always begins
with, <i>Chare Lambeci</i>. To this is affixed the following <i>Epigram</i>
on the present King of France by the said Emperor, attested
by <i>Lambecius</i> to have been written by the Emperor in his presence
at <i>Luxemburg</i>, 17 May 1666.</p>

<p>The celebrated <i>Ms.</i> of <i>Jacobus Strada</i>, antiquary to <i>Maximilian</i>
the second, concerning antient medals; consisting of eight volumes
in this order: Vol. i. and ii. <i>De nummis consularibus.</i>
Vol. iii. <i>De Latinis, a Julio Caesare ad Nervum.</i> Vol. iv. <i>De iisdem,
a Nervo ad Alexandrum Severum.</i> Vol. v. <i>De iisdem, ab

ad triginta illos sub Gallieno tyrannos.</i> This work contains
a collection of fair and choice medals, all exquisitely delineated
by a pencil, each of which fills a whole page in <i>folio</i>; but the explication
added by the author shews him to have been more laborious
than learned, and discovers many notorious mistakes, as
well in the tongues, as the history, to which the medals relate.</p>

<p>Two fragments, one in the <i>Greek</i>, the other in the <i>Latin
tongue</i>, written on antient bark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> case of this library is very mean, being unfurnished with
seats and benches, and divided into four or five distinct apartments,
besides another more separate from the rest, in which are
kept all prohibited, that is, controversial books in divinity, together<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
with the small remainder of <i>Matthias Corvinus’s</i> library
brought from <i>Buda</i>. But it is still a greater disadvantage to this
library, that since the death of <i>Nesselius</i> it has for two years been
without a librarian, and therefore is difficult of access, and not
without a considerable fee. This defect is attributed to the great
scarcity of learned men in these parts, especially those of the Roman
faith; for which reason the two preceding librarians, <i>Lambecius</i>
and <i>Nesselius</i>, being before Lutherans, were obliged to renounce
their faith, when they accepted that employ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Over</span> against the library is a long gallery, adjoining likewise
to the palace, wherein is contained the Emperor’s treasury. A noble
and truly royal collection is here of innumerable curiosities, both of
art and nature, with vast riches in silver, gold, pretious stones, and
jewels. But this likewise has the disgrace of being meanly exposed
to sale, nor is it ever shewn under the exorbitant fee of
twenty five florins; however I obtained two opportunities of viewing
it, in the latter of which I took a large and distinct catalogue
of the chief rarities deposited there, which would be too large to
be here inserted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> university of this place is a numerous society, appropriated
to several distinct nations, particularly those of the empire, and the
Emperor’s hereditary dominions; but it is remarkable for nothing
but a low contracted institution, and administered wholly by the
Jesuites, except that they refuse the office of <i>rector magnificus</i>,
as being an expensive honour. The schools are tolerable and convenient
apartments, adjoining to the Jesuits college; but the particular
students are lodged privately, as every one’s circumstances
and conveniency best serve him. But what they call the <i>academy</i>
is in its kind more flourishing than the university; being a society
instituted at the charge of the whole province of Austria, to instruct
the young gentry and nobility in riding, fencing, dancing,
the modern tongues, heraldry, history, and other polite arts. Their
riding school is a noble room; and adjoining thereto is a stable of
about forty managed horses, for the maintaining of which their
instructor in horsemanship receives ten thousand florins annually
from the public.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> present Imperial family ordinarily residing in this palace
consists of the Emperor; the Empress <i>Leonora</i>; the King and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
Queen of the <i>Romans</i>; Archduke <i>Charles</i>; with the four Archdutchesses,
<i>Marta Elisabeth</i>, <i>Maria Anna</i>, <i>Maria Josepha</i>, <i>Maria
Magdalena</i>. Of these the Emperor has now passed sixty two years
of his age, the King of the <i>Romans</i> twenty four, and the Archduke
will be seventeen in October next; the two elder of the Archdutchesses
have been some time marriageable, but the two younger
are in their state of childhood. The Emperor is of a mild disposition,
and conscientiously just, except where influenced by
popish principles; he reasons solidly, has a happy memory, is
both a lover and composer of music, skilled in the Hungarian,
Sclavonian, and French tongues, and has an elegant taste of the
Italian and Latin. Both he and his Empress appear truly devout in
their way, which they testify by many instances of diffusive liberality
and charity, as likewise by their frequent walks in processions,
and daily visiting and dining in religious convents. Their
garb, especially that of the Empress, is exceeding plain; their
coaches and liveries of the old fashion; and their ceremonious
dress is the habit and mode of Spain. Only they have now and
then, what they call their <i>Gala days</i>, in which there is a great resort
to court, and none appear there but in suits of gold and silver
embroidery. So that it is the wisdom of this government, which
has little reason to brag of its riches, to make this sort of luxury
necessary, at a time when its more wealthy neighbours have either
by prudent choice, or wholesome laws, wholly retrenched these
superfluities. But to return to the character of the family. The
Emperor is not only devout, but even bigoted to the Romish
church, and fondly addicted to the priests, especially the Jesuits.
The King of the <i>Romans</i> on the contrary is severely imbittered
against them, but the Archduke is inclinable to tread in
his father’s steps. The Empress will sometimes undertake pilgrimages
on foot to some famous shrine, or image, in the adjoining
country; and promises herself no doubt great benefits from that
painful superstition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> King of the <i>Romans</i> was gone to the siege of <i>Landaw</i> before
our arrival; but the remainder of the Imperial family I had
frequent opportunity of seeing, particularly at their supper, or
the operas, which are sometimes acted in a theatre at the <i>Favorite</i>.
It is their custom to salute the Emperor by bowing the knee.
Their table is truly moderate, and a remarkable example of temperance
and parsimony. Their operas are excessive dull, the action<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
mean and trivial, and therefore more agreable to the low genius
and relish of this place. Another occasion, that offered me the sight
of the Emperor and the Archduke, was at a certain sport, with
which in summer time they frequently divert themselves. They
send out a large and expensive train of carts, laden with tents,
canvas, poles, and other utensils, into one of their adjoining
parks. There in an open green a tent is pitched for the Emperor
and his retinue, round which a large and long space of ground is
enclosed with high rails of canvas. When the Emperor is arrived,
and ready to begin his diversion, a rank of huntsmen sound their
horns, the rails drop at one end, and the grand <i>cacciatóre</i> rides
out with his attendants to drive in an herd of deer, enclosed near
at hand for this purpose. This done, they are forced up to the
Emperor’s tent, till at the distance of about twenty yards they
stand in a throng together. Hereupon his Imperial Majesty takes
a well poised carbine, rests it upon a fixt support, then applies a
perspective glass to the barrel, and discharges among the herd;
and thus, with the help of the Archduke, he stuns, or maims perhaps,
a dozen at twice as many shots. At length they sit down to
diner, there talk over their diversion, and give this ignoble slaughter
the name of a hunt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">During</span> my stay at <i>Vienna</i>, I had the opportunity of three
accidental but remarkable sights. The first of these was the execution
of a woman by decollation, whose head the executioner
struck off, as she sat in a chair, at one blow, levelled against the
back part of her neck, with a two handed stroke, and a broad
two edged sword. At these executions there assists, as in Italy,
a number of about twenty persons, called the <i>confraternity of the
dead</i>, habited in black, with masks, broad brimed hats, and
mourning staves. They are a fixed society, composed of citizens
of the middle rank, on whom their confessors impose it, as a piece
of penance, to assist <i>incognito</i> on these occasions. But most remarkable
was the fact and behaviour of the criminal, who was
about twenty six years of age, and in the absence of her husband,
now three years imprisoned at <i>Presburg</i>, had admitted the embraces
of a young man, whom she passionately loved, but at length
discovered to be upon the design of marrying another woman.
After the most earnest but fruitless endeavours to divert his intention,
she invites him one morning to a walk beyond the <i>Favorite</i>,
and in a remote place enticing him to kiss her, takes occasion to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
shoot him in the head. This done, she immediately resigns herself
to justice, reveals the whole fact, and implores her speedy dispatch;
that so she might have his company in the other world,
without whom she could not live in this. She walked with a fresh
undaunted countenance to the place of sentence, which tho before
designed and notified accordingly, yet is never formally pronounced
till the time of execution. From thence she returned to
the place of her death, sat down in the chair, and then received
the stroke, without ever wavering her body, changing her complexion,
or dreading the blow she was to feel. At these executions
they often catch the blood of the criminal, as good against
the falling sickness<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Another</span> ceremony that occurred, while I resided here, was
the investiture of the Duke of <i>Saxony</i>, and other inferior Princes
of that circle, now at length demanded of his Imperial Majesty,
at the <i>Favorite</i>, on the eighth of August. The five several representatives
of the Elector and other Princes kneeling before the Emperor,
who was seated on a low throne, did fealty in behalf of
their respective patrons, rehearsed their pedigrees and title to their
principalities, and requested of his Imperial Majesty to be invested
in their several dignities. This being granted to them, they then
took the proper oath at the feet of the Emperor; afterwards kissed
the handle of a sword, which he held forth to each of them; and
at last retiring to their first places, there on their knees they
recognized the authority of his Imperial Majesty, and so were dismissed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> third solemnity was a pompous procession, undertaken to
accompany the bones of three Saints, namely, <i>Sancta Victoria</i>,
<i>Sanctus Alexander</i>, and <i>Sanctus Justus</i>, from <i>St. Stephen’s</i> to the
chapel of the Emperor’s palace in the city. They were newly
brought from Italy, where being observed by Prince <i>Leichtenstein</i>
in his late embassy to <i>Rome</i>, and found to have some relation to
Hungary, of which two of them were natives; they were thought
proper to be transmitted to <i>Vienna</i>, and accordingly purchased
very dear, one of them standing him in no less than four thousand
florins. In this procession marched all the religious orders,
ranked in their several fraternities, except that the Jesuit disposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
themselves promiscuously among the laity. After the
monks and friars followed the meaner people, to the number of
about two thousand; then the gentry, tho in a smaller number;
after them a few of the nobility; then the Archduke and Emperor;
and last of all the Empress and Archdutchesses. Each
person of this numerous train maintained a decent gravity, except
the Archbishop of <i>Vienna</i>, who being dressed in his episcopal robes
and mitre walked like a horse in gaudy trappings, flinging about
his legs, surveying his rich vestments, and looking up to the ladies
and other spectators, who admired him from the windows,
under which he passed.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">August</span> xxvii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day I went in a calash, together with Mr. Montague and
Mr. <i>Gaugain</i>, to <i>Petronel</i>, a village on the <i>Danube</i>, about
twenty four English miles from <i>Vienna</i>, seated in the place of
the antient <i>Carnuntum</i>, where <i>M. Antoninus</i> held his capital quarters
to bridle the <i>Marcomanni</i> for the space of three years, and
then retiring on account of his indisposition to <i>Vindobona</i> died
there. While we were on the road, I was entertained by those
gentlemen, with a relation of what they had seen the day before.
Count <i>Sherradin</i> of <i>Bohemia</i> had several times shot a pistol bullet
into a mark of the size of a florin, at the distance of forty yards.
And at this he is said to be so expert, that his pages will venture
to hold a florin between their thumb and forefinger, which he
dextrously uses to strike without hurting them. The like is sometimes
practised by the present King of <i>Poland</i>, tho he once broke
the fingers of a page in making the experiment. We here saw
the remains of a triumphal arch, the <i>fornix</i> of which is yet intire;
erected, as is thought by <i>Nesselius</i> and <i>Lambecius</i>, on occasion of
that <i>Pannonian</i> expedition of <i>Tiberius</i>, which is so much celebrated
by <i>Paterculus</i><a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>. The inhabitants here shewed us various Roman
coins, tho none of any noted value. The village now belongs to
Count <i>Traun</i>, who is descended from <i>Babo</i>, count of <i>Abensberg</i>,
who had forty children by two lawful wives; thirty two of which,
being sons, were presented by him to the Emperor, <i>Henry</i> the
second, who prefered them all. Count <i>Traun</i> has here a stately
palace, called the <i>Castle</i>, where we saw the story of the thirty two
sons of Count <i>Babo</i> painted at large<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>. The house is moted round,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
as is usual all over this country. In the inside is a noble hall,
well painted in the roof, and at the entrance of the gate is fixt
an antient Latin inscription, which I have here transcribed.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">August</span> xxix.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">His</span> Excellency with his whole family retired this day from
<i>Vienna</i> to <i>Baden</i>, a small town, yet enclosed with an old wall,
and celebrated for its baths, which are of pure sulphur. They rise
in several places about the town, without any mixture of steel or
other mineral, and are there collected into several square cisterns
railed about with wood; where people of different quality bathe
in distinct bagnios, and in some cases with good success. The
town is seated four hours from <i>Vienna</i>, at the foot of the hills,
which I take to be the <i>Pannonian Alps</i>. In this place Mr. Paget
and I used the constant exercise of walking morning and evening,
where I experienced a happy restoration of my health, once much
debilitated in Turkey. <i>Gloria in excelsis Deo!</i></p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">September</span> xxv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">His</span> Excellency now sent Mr. Paget and myself to see the castle
of <i>Luxemburg</i>, situated in the way betwixt <i>Baden</i> and <i>Vienna</i>. It
is a mean building, in the form of a small quadrangle, and
moted round. I observed several curious pictures in it, one particularly
fine of the <i>seven liberal sciences</i>, in the dining room of
the Emperor; another of the present <i>King of France</i>, when about
four years of age; a third of <i>Charles the fifth</i>; a fourth of <i>Matthias
Corvinus</i> and his father <i>Huniades</i>. The dining room is observable
for an accident of thunder, which, while the Emperor
and his family were at diner, entered the room at one quarter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
passed in a semicircle about the table, and made its way thro the
opposite wall with great explosion; while the Emperor remained
in his seat with a remarkable calmness and serenity of mind. Adjoining
to this building is a delightful park enclosed with pales;
and nearer to the house a thick grove of elm and oak, in which
is a long walk, and avenues so cut, as to resemble all the streets
of <i>Vienna</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">September</span> xxix.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day Mr. Paget and I by the direction of his Excellency
went to see a glass house, newly erected in the hills adjoining to
this place, at the distance of about three hours. Our way thither
lay thro a delicious vale, which conveys a small river, is graced
with green meadows on each side, and above these with rising
hills, adorned with a variety of trees, but particularly pines and
firs. I here observed the several curiosities of that art and manufacture,
which, tho frequent in England, I had never before seen.
Returning home we stept a little to the left hand, to visit a convent
of <i>Cistercian</i> monks, by the name of <i>St. Cross</i>, founded in
the year 1131, by <i>St. Leopold</i>, Marquess of <i>Austria</i>. During the
late siege of <i>Vienna</i> it was burnt by the Tartars (the common fate
of all this country for thirty or forty Holland miles round <i>Vienna</i>)
but soon after rebuilt by its own abbot, <i>Clement Scheffer</i>, in a more
stately and splendid manner. Here reside an abbot, a prior, and
about sixty monks, all royally maintained by noble revenues belonging
to the monastery. They are neatly and gentilely dressed,
lodged in pleasant chambers, have their public appartments alike
magnificent, a fine garden, and prospects beautified with vistos
and avenues cut in the adjoining woods. The abbot was then
absent, but the prior and librarian treated us at supper, where we
were served with seven or eight dishes, the best old wines, and
conversation far from monkish. The librarian particularly was
pleased to ridicule the custom of signing all the doors of this country
with C. M. B. which the people fondly esteem a charm
against fire and thievery; but he, as he said, instead of <i>Cuspar
Malcheir Bulkasar</i>, was wont to interpret these letters <i>Cax Mundus
Beelzebub</i>. At the same time I could not but be highly offended
at a certain jocular freedom, with which he treated the <i>Holy Scripture</i>,
saying with a profane mirth, when he delivered to us a glass
of wine, <i>Transeat a me calix iste</i>; and when he had tossed off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
his own, <i>Consummatum est</i>. In truth we here saw not any token
of popish zeal or superstition, as is usual in other places, no crucifixes,
or images of the <i>Trinity</i>, <i>Virgin</i>, and the like; but instead
of these, the whole Imperial family excellently well painted,
and these in rooms, which for grandeur exceeded any, that
the Emperor is master of in his palaces about <i>Vienna</i>. Here they
favoured us with a lodging after a gentile and candid entertainment,
and dismissed us in the like manner by eight a clock the next
morning. Their library was mean, but the case very neat; tho
the library had been much larger before the destruction by the
Tartars. However I saw here a good Latin <i>Ms.</i> of the <i>New Testament</i>,
without the <i>Epistles</i> of <i>St. Peter</i>, <i>James</i>, or <i>John</i>; and the
<i>Apocalypse</i> placed immediately after <i>St. John’s Gospel</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">October</span> iv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">My</span> Lord and his family now returned from <i>Baden</i> to <i>Vienna</i>,
where he lodged within the city in the house of <i>C. Stratman</i>, at
the rate of five hundred florins a month. At <i>Baden</i> I was able
to observe nothing, except some small matters relating to country
affairs. As their way of making wine in the field, where they
mash the grapes in broad open tubs, and tun it into large casks,
as they lie in the cart. The manner of enclosing their vineyards
with high poles joined at the top, and burnt at bottom to secure
them from corrupting by the moisture of the ground. The manner
of drawing sometimes with asses, and at other times with oxen,
joining the harness to their horns without the use of yokes. I
observed likewise their custom of calling a public officer upon the
death of any animal; before which they dare not touch the carcass,
he only being impowered to carry it away to a certain
place, and there flea it, for which he receives three florins. This
officer is called the <i>hound slayer</i>, because twice a year he is obliged
to kill all the dogs both in town and country, that are found
without a collar, which is thought an institution against spreading
of infectious diseases.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">October</span> v.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day I waited upon Mr. Stepney, who among other papers
from England shewed me that traiterous Epigram, written in
praise of <i>Sorrel</i>, or the horse, from which his late Majesty received
his fatal fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">October</span> xxv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">There</span> was brought to his Excellency’s house a male child,
seven years of age, born at <i>Rigetsch</i>, three miles and a half from
<i>Papa</i>, of a beautiful countenance, but without legs or thighs; and
the left hand deformed, but the right intire. It walks, and raises
itself with ease, while its trunk supplies the use of one leg, and
the right hand that of the other. The hips terminate in a round
figure, not unlike a woman’s breasts, and have in the middle an
excrescence exactly resembling a large nipple. The child is
healthy and lively, and from the crown of the head to the extremity
of the trunk is three palms and a half long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">I had</span> now, in company of several English gentlemen, an opportunity
of seeing the Emperor’s collection of pictures, which is
exposed at the price of twelve florins. It consists of three long
galleries, with four or five large and square chambers. The
whole number of pieces amounts to a thousand six hundred
and sixty three, performed by the best hands of Europe, particularly
these which follow: <i>Albert Durer</i>, <i>Anton. Correggio</i>,
<i>Bassan</i>, <i>Palma</i> senior and junior, <i>Prugel</i> senior and junior, <i>Paul
Veronese</i>, <i>Bronzini</i>, <i>Franck</i> senior, <i>Paduanino</i>, <i>Jo. Bellino</i>, <i>Poussin</i>,
<i>Gerome Poss</i>, <i>Portononi</i>, <i>Spagnoletto</i>, <i>Raphael Sancio</i>, <i>Giorgioni</i>,
<i>Titian</i>, <i>Tintoretto</i>, <i>Van Ach</i>, <i>Holbein</i>, <i>Rubens</i>, <i>Van Dick</i>, <i>John
de Heem</i>, <i>Pauditz</i>, and others. Among these there was one piece
of <i>Raphael</i>, which seemed to excel the rest, being <i>a saint holding
a crucifix</i>, which belonged to the cabinet of King <i>Charles</i> the
first of England, and was sold by <i>Oliver</i> to this court for twelve
thousand florins. Besides this collection of pictures, there is another
set of rarities, preserved in a cabinet at one end of the third
gallery, and consisting of <i>intaglios</i> and <i>cameos</i>; among which is a
large head of <i>Domitian</i> in agate; a series of gold medals, and
among them two of <i>Otho</i>, to which is added a <i>Pisennius Niger</i>
in silver of the third size. In the same cabinet are several small
statues of brass and stone, among the rest those of <i>Venus</i> and
<i>Hercules</i>; and likewise several antient busts, particularly of <i>Plato</i>
and <i>Aristotle</i>; with divers sepulchral lamps, urns, and other remains
of antiquity. To say nothing of the curiosities found in
the tomb of <i>Childeric</i> the first by <i>Leopold William</i>, Archduke of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
<i>Austria</i>, and uncle to this Emperor, at <i>Tournay</i> in the year 1657.
Among these are some remarkable gold coins of that time, with
the repeated emblem of flies or bees, the wings of which at a distance
give the figure of a <i>flower de lys</i>, and are supposed to be
the real arms of France, tho this resemblance has occasioned their
being mistaken for that flower. But more especially is to be remembred
the order of antient busts ranged on one side of the three
galleries, among which are several heads of <i>Emperors</i>, and <i>Satyrs</i>,
with one of <i>Socrates</i>; as likewise an intire figure of <i>Magna Mater
turrita</i>, with a <i>lion</i> under her chair, a <i>tympanum</i> in her left hand,
and <i>patina</i> in her right; which cost this court a thousand florins
at <i>Rome</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">November</span> iii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">I went</span> to visit Mr. <i>C. Boét</i>, a famous painter in enamel, who
had a salary from his late Majesty, whose picture, with those of
other confederate Princes, drawn by him he now shewed me. But
that which is most remarkable, he is at present working for this
court the largest piece, that ever was known in enamel, being
an oval of eighteen inches by fifteen; which contains the figures
of the Emperor and Empress, King and Queen of the <i>Romans</i>,
with the Archduke, the four Archdutchesses, and the two young
Daughters of the King of the <i>Romans</i>. He was sent for hither by his
late Majesty on purpose for this work, for which when finished
he is by compact to receive four thousand ducats of gold. The
materials of it are a copper plate covered with a white enamel,
which being hardened in the fire, is afterwards painted over in
colours of a peculiar composition, with oil of lavender and rosemary;
and then again put into the fire to receive a gloss, and additional
hardness; after which it is liable to no accident, but that
of breaking. It may be observed, that all the red colours in this
work are made of gold.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">November</span> vi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day by order of his Excellency I waited on the two young
<i>Messieurs Olmeus</i> and others, in order to see the Emperor’s treasury
the third time, and thereby perfected my catalogue of those rarities.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
And his Excellency being then preparing for his departure, the
Emperor presented him with six thousand dollars.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">November</span> viii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">His</span> Excellency with his retinue now set forward from <i>Vienna</i>
towards <i>Holland</i>, and proceed two german miles to <i>Entzersdorff</i>.
A little before the midway we cross the <i>Danube</i> over a wooden
bridge four hundred paces in length, and continue near the banks
of the river to the above mentioned town. And as we continued
there the following day, I walked down to the banks of the
<i>Danube</i>, where it flows under the castle of <i>St. Leopold</i>, near <i>Cloyster
Newburg</i>, and in the extreme point of <i>Mons Cetius</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">November</span> x.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day we proceed two German miles and a half further to
<i>Stockeran</i>, and there meet C. <i>Schlick</i>, Mr. Stepney, Mr. Montague,
and Mr. <i>Gangain</i>, with whom we proceed three miles and a half
further to our lodgings at <i>Holibrun</i>. And from thence his Excellency,
with the said company, the next morning goes out
an hour to Count <i>Sereny’s</i>, there to wait on the King of the <i>Romans</i>,
now returning from the campaign on the <i>Rhine</i>. By one a
clock the King and Queen arrived at the Count’s, where his Excellency
had an audience of both their Majesties; after which they
sat down to table, and his Excellency and company dined with the
court, and afterwards returned to <i>Holibrun</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">November</span> xii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day we advance about five miles further in <i>Austria</i>, and
then crossing the <i>Teya</i> enter into <i>Moravia</i>, now called <i>Makren</i>,
and take up our quarters at <i>Znaim</i>, the <i>Medoslanium</i> of Ptolemy.
This is a fair and fortified town, tho of the old fashion, upon the
river <i>Teya</i>, which runs hence into the <i>Morawa</i>, antiently the <i>Marus</i>,
and with that into the <i>Danube</i>. In the year 1645 this town
was taken and pillaged by the Swedes. It has two market places,
in each of which is a good fountain; and in one of them the
image of the <i>Virgin</i>, erected on a fair pillar, and inscribed with
a new sort of <i>Gloria Patri</i>, that is, <span class="smcap">Lavs Deo</span>, <span class="smcap">Mariaeqve Virgini</span>,
<span class="smcap">Sanctisque svis</span>. There are likewise several convents,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
of Capuchines, Dominicans, Jesuits, and Premonstratensians; and
it is remarkable for excellent endive.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">November</span> xiii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> stay this day at <i>Znaim</i>, and the day following proceed
three German miles to <i>Budwitz</i>, thro pleasant woods of fir, with
fertile open feilds. And moving from thence the next morning,
three more German miles carry us thro <i>Babitz</i> and <i>Drumna</i> to
<i>Pernitz</i>, by a pleasant way, thro a country sometimes open and
well tilled; and at other times thro delightful woods of pine or
fir, intermixt with juniper and a few birch; but scarce any other
shrubs or trees in the whole country. At <i>Pernitz</i> is a convent of
<i>Paulins</i>, so called from <i>Sto. Francisco di Paula</i>, a strict order, that
eats no flesh nor fish throughout the year. In this place live several
Jews, who are bound to wear blue ruffs, as a mark of distinction.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">November</span> xvi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Two</span> German miles thro woods of fir and arable ground bring
us to <i>Iglaw</i>. This city, reasonably well fortified, has a large and
clean market place, round which the houses have false fronts, and
are handsomely painted on the outside with pleasant landskips or
histories. At the upper end of it is a statue of the <i>Virgin</i> on a
column, like that at <i>Znaim</i>; both seeming to be an imitation of
that at <i>Vienna</i>. We bait an hour at <i>Iglaw</i>, and then pass on one
German mile to a small village, called <i>Steken</i>. But immediately
beyond the wall of <i>Iglaw</i> we pass a river of the same name, and
there enter into <i>Bohemia</i>, whence we continue our way over a
large lake, with a road cast up betwixt the two branches of it, and
delicate woods of fir adorning its banks. This wood is of large
extent, and seems to be a continuation of the <i>Sylva Hercynia</i> in
this country, now called <i>Behemerwaldt</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">November</span> xvii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> stay this day at <i>Steken</i>, where I had leisure to observe in
general concerning <i>Moravia</i>, that the country is fertile and well
tilled, except where it is overrun with pine or fir woods. The
people are all slaves to the lords of the several mansions; but this
extends only to their labour, not the property of their gain. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
language of the place is <i>Behemish</i>, a dialect of the <i>Sclavonian</i>; but
at inns and other public houses they ordinarily speak <i>Tuysech</i>. The
government it divided into five districts, of which there are as
many captains, but the command of the whole province is committed
by the Emperor to Count <i>Thorn</i>. The river <i>Morawa</i> is
likewise called <i>Mark</i> by the Germans; which latter name seems
to relate to the antient inhabitants, the <i>Marcomanni</i> (who with
the <i>Quadi</i> were here settled) as the former name does to the
<i>Moravians</i>. Through the whole extent of the country we frequent
meet with large lakes, at the distance perhaps of an English
mile.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">November</span> xviii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day we proceed one mile and a half to <i>Tuytschenbrodt</i>, an
old fortification on the river <i>Sazawa</i>, and from thence two miles
to <i>Habern</i>, in a wood on the right hand. <i>Tuytschenbrodt</i> was the
place, where General <i>Zeiska</i> beat the Emperor <i>Sigismund</i>, and by
that defeat drove him out of Bohemia.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">November</span> xix.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">One</span> mile brings us this day to <i>Janikaw</i>, and two more from
thence to <i>Czaslaw</i>; the place where <i>Ferdinand</i> the second narrowly
escaped being assassinated by an Italian, hid for that purpose in
an oven. Half a mile farther carries us to a small hamlet, called
<i>Wasser Cratz</i>. Of these towns <i>Janikaw</i> is the place, where the
battle was fought betwixt the Swedes and Imperialists in 1645;
and <i>Czaslaw</i>, where General <i>Zeiska</i> lies buried.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">November</span> xx.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">From</span> <i>Wasser Cratz</i> we proceed one quarter of a German mile,
and then having the city of <i>Kuttenberg</i> on our left hand, a little
farther in the road we pass by two Imperial mines, where they
are now at work, and dig up a mixt oar, consisting of copper,
lead, and silver, a specimen of which they then shewed us. At
one mile and a half from our last lodging we come to <i>Kottin</i>, and
there breakfast. Then proceeding another mile and a half, we
arrive at <i>Blanyan</i>. From <i>Kottin</i> flows the river <i>Elb</i>, which takes
its name about five miles below that place, and is there scarce navigable.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
As we travel, we keep it in sight on the right hand, and
the woods still on the left.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">November</span> XXI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Two</span> miles and a half from <i>Branyan</i> carry us to <i>Oval</i>, thro an
open arable country, with a continued tract of woods on our left
hand. In the midway we bait at the poor town of <i>Bohaimsbrodt</i>.
But the day following for two miles and a half we pass thro a
pleasant grove of birch and pine, and afterwards thro open
ploughed feilds to <i>Prague</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">November</span> xxiii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">His</span> Excellency staying this day at <i>Prague</i>, I took that opportunity
of viewing every thing I could of that noble city, which is
thought to be the largest in Germany. It is inclosed with one intire
wall, two third parts of which are regularly divided into curtains
and bastions; but the remaining third is old and defenceless.
Tho indeed the whole town is commanded by ascending ground,
that no fortification can make it long defensible. The <i>Muldaw</i>,
a large and rapid river, divides it into two parts, which are again
joined by a fair and stately bridge of stone, seventeen hundred
feet long and thirty five broad, supported by twenty four arches.
Both parts of the city are adorned with great variety of magnificent
buildings, the most remarkable of which I visited in this
order.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Adjoining</span> to the <i>Star</i> inn, where his Excellency lodged, is
the new convent of Irish <i>Cordeliers</i>; and in the same neighbourhood
are two seminaries, one called that of the <i>Archbishop</i>, and
the other that of <i>St. Norbert</i>, patron of this kingdom; both which
profess academical learning, but in societies distinct
from the university of the place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Hence</span> the way leads us to the townhouse, a large and stately
building, which at one corner has a piece of clock work, giving
the motions of the seven planets. On one side of this opens a fair
piazza, with two curious pieces of workmanship. The first of
these is a statue of the <i>B. Virgin</i> trampling on the <i>Dragon</i>, erected
on a stone pillar, on the pedestal of which are four <i>Angels</i> defeating
the like venomous monsters. This implies a triumphant declaration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
of her immaculate conception, and imitates that work
before observed at <i>Vienna</i>. The second curiosity is a fountain of
carved marble, with a basin of twelve sides, on which are cut very
beautifully the twelve signs of the <i>Zodiac</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">From</span> hence we pass to a college of Jesuits, a noble and spatious
building. The church is a fine fabric, and prodigiously
rich; the cloister large, and adorned with agreable pictures;
among the rest are large tables divided into little squares, containing
the short history and pourtraiture of the eminent persons
of their order for preaching, missions, and conversions, among
whom are a great number of English.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> same way leads us to the bridge above mentioned, and
thence to another college of the Jesuits; but the third, and most
splendid of this order, is in that part of <i>Prague</i> called the new
city, which we had not an opportunity of seeing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> now turn to the right hand, and in an eminent part of the
city are brought to the Emperor’s palace, old and irregular in outward
appearance, but within its precincts is the old cathedral
church, an handsome Gothic building of the year 923, as appears
by an inscription on the chief altar. The stateliness of the old
architecture, with the richness as well as beauty of the modern
ornaments, make it a venerable pile. They have here a picture
of the <i>Virgin</i>, which is pretended to be of <i>St. Luke’s</i> hand. At
the gate entering into this palace there is another in sight, which
is the residence of the Archbishop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">From</span> the cathedral we are carried to the <i>Capuchin</i> cloister,
which consists of a small but most beautiful quadrangle. Round
the four sides, under a fair portico, are painted thirty different copies
of so many of the most eminent and miraculous images of the
<i>Virgin</i>, each in the proper garb, posture, and colours of the originals;
and the remaining space of the wall beneath is filled with
votive tables, in acknowledgement of favours received from each
picture. I thought this collection observable, in that it is an apparent
instance of the different representations of the <i>B. Virgin</i>,
who is not invoked under the same character in all places,
and on all occasions; but according to the fancy of the first painters,
and the superstition of the late devotees, is split into so many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
distinct objects of worship; as the Lady <i>de Victoria</i>, <i>de Litera</i>,
<i>de Consilio</i>, <i>Crysostomiana</i>, <i>Cyrilliana</i>, <i>Bernardina</i>, <i>Lauretana</i>, <i>Eremitana</i>,
<i>Cellensis</i>, <i>Passaviensis</i>, <i>Wranoviensis</i>, <i>Hallensis</i>. As this
shews how polytheism crept in among the heathen, who first of all
worshiped God under so many distinct attributes, and afterwards
as so many distinct beings; so it argues greater superstition in the
church of Rome: for instead of the several characters of <i>Venus</i>,
as <i>Cypria</i>, <i>Cytherea</i>, <i>Victrix</i>, and others; or of <i>Diana</i>, as <i>Aricinia</i>,
<i>Leucophryne</i>, <i>Taurica</i><a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>; we have many more of <i>Sta. Maria</i>.
In the middle of this quadrangle is an handsome imitation of
the chapel of <i>Loretto</i> with the <i>Virgin</i> and our <i>Savior</i> above
the altar in the complection of <i>Moors</i>; and on the outside walls
are various religious stories elegantly represented.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">From</span> hence we proceed to the celebrated cloister of Premonstratensians,
called the <i>Shawhoff</i> in which above an hundred persons
are maintained in a princely manner. I was here shewn a
rich chapel, wherein before the incursion of the Swedes were many
large and curious statues of solid brass, particularly those of the
twelve <i>Apostles</i>; which by Count <i>Koningsmarck</i> were converted into
canon, when he took this part of the city, tho he was soon again
repulsed. In the middle of the church, in a stately open monument,
is preserved the body of <i>St. Norbert</i>, the founder of this
order. Over the tomb is suspended a gilt crown of a prodigious size,
the diameter of the rimb being at least three ells. After the chapel
I saw their library, which is neat and well filled, but with books
in the taste of the last age. They have here a monkish contrivance
of a wheeling desk with six sides, on each of which may lie
several books, so as to be turned round in their order, without
falling off in the motion. From the library we passed to their
private chapel, wherein is a crucifix, which the monk, who shewed
it us, attested to have seen illuminated in the night, while no
candle was in the room. In an adjoining gallery is a large statue
of our <i>Savior</i>, which they affirm to have once sweat blood about
the neck, and shew the marks thereof still remaining. From hence
we are carried to their winter refectory, a large and regular stove
room, well contrived for warmth and beauty at the same time.
But their summer refectory is a pattern of beauty, proportion,
and magnificence, being paved with black and white marble, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
three large windows on one side, and round the walls about
twelve large pictures of eminent persons of their order; and the
whole is exceedingly well contrived, both for the entertainment
of the mind, and repose of the body. They shewed us likewise
another large room, with a numerous collection of their most meritorious
members in little squares; and last of all the chambers
of the monks, with two adjoining gardens, one for the fathers,
the other for the brethren of the society, which completed the
pleasure of the sight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Next</span> to this convent we went to see a Jewish synagogue, of
which there are eight in this place, the number of that nation
amounting to above ten thousand, who for distinction sake are all
obliged to wear a blue ruff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">On</span> the stately bridge over the <i>Muldaw</i> are to be observed several
curious statues of the <i>Virgin</i>; of our <i>Savior</i>; and of the
new <i>Saint</i> lately set up in all parts of this kingdom, as well as on
all the bridges of <i>Vienna</i>, being a curious piece of cast brass with
this inscription:</p>

<div class="inscription-container">
<div class="inscription">
<div class="line-l">DIVO IOANNI NEPOMENENO ANNO MCCCLXXXIII</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He was here drowned for not revealing to the King of Bohemia a
confession of his Queen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> famous university of this place, which in the time of <i>John
Huss</i> consisted of forty thousand students, is not even now so far
diminished, but that when they have occasion to assault the Jews, or
other citizens, they can muster about twelve thousand. They consist
of young persons, not collected into regular societies, as with
us, but lodging in private houses, from whence they repair to the
public schools at the appointed hours of lecture. There are three
of these schools, one in each part of the city, where all academical
learning is professed by the ablest of the Jesuits; for these
have the sole direction of the university, and are the only rich
prevailing persons in Bohemia, particularly in the capital city,
where they amount to the number of a thousand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">November</span> xxiv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day we leave <i>Prague</i>, and proceed four miles, thro an
open ploughed country, to <i>Sloney</i>. In the way we receive the confirmation
of the good news, which we first heard at <i>Iglaw</i>; that
seventeen Spanish galleons in the port of <i>Vigo</i> were fallen under
the power of our grand fleet, eleven being taken, and six sunk;
and that the whole squadron of <i>Chateaurenault</i>, being twenty nine
men of war, were either sunk or taken.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">November</span> xxv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">His</span> Excellency continues yet at <i>Sloney</i>, a small but walled
town, with a large market place, as usual in these parts. It was
formerly a seat of protestants, and therefore barbarously destroyed
by <i>Ferdinand</i> the third. The day following we intend for <i>Launa</i>,
three miles from hence; but the place being taken up for the
quarters of five thousand Saxon soldiers, now moving against Bavaria,
we lodge at <i>Clamston</i>, half an hour short of it; where we
continue two days, by reason of a great quantity of snow, which
then fell.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">November</span> xxix.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Leaving</span> <i>Clamston</i>, at the distance of one quarter of a German
mile we pass under the walls of <i>Launa</i>, and there cross the
<i>Egra</i> by a long wooden bridge, covered with a penthouse, as is
usual in this country. From thence we come to <i>Bitin</i>, the estate
of Prince <i>Lobcowitz</i>, where we bait one hour; and from thence
proceed to <i>Deplitz</i>, the estate and seat of Count <i>Clery</i>, remarkable
for an hot bath.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">November</span> xxx.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">His</span> Excellency from hence designed the straight road, by the way
of <i>Framstein</i>, <i>Friburg</i> (where are silver mines, and the tombs of
the electors of Saxony) <i>Waltheim</i>, <i>Coldick</i>, <i>Walcowitz</i>, and so to
<i>Leipsick</i>. In the mean time he permitted me to quit his retinue,
in order to see <i>Dresden</i>. With this intent I take a post waggon
from <i>Deplitz</i> to <i>Peterswaldt</i>, the distance of two miles, in which
I pass the hill of <i>Kaiasberg</i>. From <i>Peterswaldt</i> I take a new post,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
and soon after I have left the town pass the boundary of <i>Bohemia</i>
and <i>Saxony</i>; and at two miles end changing post at a little
village not far from <i>Pirn</i>, by this third post I come under its
walls, and presently am upon the banks of the <i>Elbe</i>, along which
I ride about half an hour, and then quitting the river arrive about
five a clock at <i>Dresden</i>, being in all six miles from <i>Deplitz</i>. It being
now dark, I repair immediately to my lodgings at the house
of one <i>Leonard Serert</i>, betwixt the two market places, a civil host,
who spoke both French and Italian. The way from <i>Peterswaldt</i>
to <i>Dresden</i> is very agreable, being interspersed with woods of
fir. The villages are better built, and more populous, than those
of <i>Bohemia</i>; where indeed neither towns nor villages are thin,
but the people very few, and those dejected with a sense of poverty
and slavery, occasioned partly by the tyranny of the church, and
partly by the constitution of the government, which makes the
peasants slaves to their Lords, as in <i>Moravia</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">December</span> i.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">I continue</span> at <i>Dresden</i> this and the three following days, to
observe the curiosities of the place. It is a neat well built town,
with straight and fair streets, compact but not large, enclosed within
a regular fortification, and a deep foss constantly filled with
water. It stands upon the <i>Elbe</i>, over which it has a noble bridge,
almost as long as that of <i>Prague</i>, supported by eighteen arches,
and on each side affording a delightful prospect along the bending
chanel of the water. By this bridge the city is joined to a neat
suburb, called <i>Old Dresden</i>, the residence chiefly of merchants,
among whom I found two Englishmen, Mr. Northleigh and Mr.
Dealing, by both whom I was kindly treated. <i>Dresden</i> was
always the residence of the Electors of Saxony, till this present
Elector was chosen King of <i>Poland</i>. However it is the ordinary
seat both of the Electress, and the Prince, who is six years old; but
both of them happened to be absent now. The Deputy of the Elector
is the Prince of <i>Furstemberg</i>, who is of the Popish religion,
but the whole town is intirely Lutheran. They have three churches,
<i>St. Cross</i>, <i>Sta. Sophia</i>, and the chapel of the court. <i>St. Cross</i> is
a large antient Gothic building, well adorned in the inside, particularly
with a carved and stately altar. The number of ministers
is about twelve, whose revenue is very small, and therefore
the people here complain, that they make up that defect by the abuses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
of confession. The palace is a fair stone building, consisting of
two courts, of which the first is large and regular, adorned both
within and without with very good carving, and painting in <i>fresco</i>,
which deserves regard, particularly one part of it that fronts the
street, and represents a <i>Roman triumph</i>. The gardens are likewise
curious, and the riding school is remarkably spatious; but what
obscures every thing else in <i>Dresden</i>, and perhaps all others of the
same kind in Germany, is the <i>kunstkammer</i>, with the arsenal, and
stable of the Elector. Each of these are shewn to strangers at the
price of three florins, the curiosities of which I reduced into a
catalogue. On the bridge at <i>Dresden</i> is erected a curious brass
<i>crucifix</i>, not inferior to that of <i>Prague</i> in the workmanship, but
far exceeding it in design, and bearing an inscription, that disavows
all superstitious worship.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">December</span> iv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">At</span> six a clock this evening, it being then very dark, I take a
passage in the ordinary post chaise for <i>Leipsick</i>, paying four florins
for the space of thirteen German miles. By ten at night we come
to <i>Misten</i>, and there cross the <i>Elbe</i> over a large covered bridge.
The benefit of the star light gives me opportunity to observe some
part of the town, particularly the castle seated on very high
ground. Hence we continue our journey all night, till about
ten a clock the next morning we come to <i>Wurzen</i>, where we
dine; and then ferrying over the <i>Muldaw</i>, now a large and rapid
river, after having endured a cold and severe snow all the day,
we arrive at <i>Leipsick</i> about five a clock in the afternoon, where I
provide myself with a private lodging.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">December</span> vi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> morning his Excellency and his retinue arrive at <i>Leipsick</i>
by eleven a clock, and lodge at the <i>Golden hen</i> in the high
street, to which place I therefore now remove myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Leipsick</span> is a neat and compact place, well built, the streets
almost straight, and conveniently wide. The market place is a
regular quadrangle, surrounded with fair and lofty houses, among
which is the town hall, or court of justice. Not far from the
market is another small square, at one end of which is a new
and spatious room, to which we ascend by stone steps. This serves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
for an exchange, where the merchants meet. The city has three
large churches, one of <i>St. Nicholas</i>, another of <i>St. Thomas</i>, and
a third called the <i>New Church</i>. These are all well beautified
within, especially that of <i>St. Nicholas</i>, the altar of which is a neat
pile, representing in good sculpture the burial and resurrection of
our <i>Savior</i>, his shewing his wounds to <i>St. Thomas</i> and the other
disciples, and over the whole his ascension in a cloud. At the
upper end of the two outward isles are painted two good pieces of
perspective. The town has no public buildings, besides an old
castle, and a new hospital; the latter of which serves both for the
reception of lunatics, and also a house of correction for vagabonds.
The fortification is regular, and of the new fashion, but not of
any great importance; however it has a foss, that may be filled
with water upon occasion from the <i>Pleiss</i>, which washes the walls
of the city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> town is governed by a senate of twenty three, of whom
three, called <i>Burgomasters</i>, have the prime authority; and by a
chief magistrate, who has the title of <i>consul</i>, and is chosen annually.
The present consul is one <i>Romanus</i>, a young gentleman of
great fortune, and vast designs; who is erecting a noble palace in
the city, built of free stone. Among the senators are several persons
of quality, who have fair estates, and a learned education.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">There</span> is a good library belonging to the city, lately purchased
at the expence of the senators, and which they daily improve by
new accessions. Among the citizens of this rank and character
I contracted an acquaintance with Mr. <i>Wagner</i>, who speaks good
English, and has been long preparing a comment on the obscurities
of Barclay’s <i>Euphormio</i>, concerning which he has commissioned
me to make several enquiries. Another person of the like
learning and civility is Mr. <i>Graevius</i> (brother to the eminent
critic in Holland) who has the care of the city library, and favoured
me with the sight of it. These with many other particulars, that
might be mentioned, are arguments of a rich and flourishing city;
which is occasioned partly from the confluence of students to the
university; and partly from the benefit of three celebrated fairs
of fourteen days each, which are annually kept here, and furnished
with merchandizes of all sorts, not only from the several
parts of Germany, but likewise from Italy, Hungary, France,
Holland, England, and other countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> staple commodities of the town are the linen manufacture,
and a natural blue earth, which is dug only in some metalic
mines of Saxony, and which to the vast advantage of this
place is exported from hence to England, Holland, and elsewhere,
for the use of dying. As to the execution of justice, adultery is
here a capital crime, but in this case the criminal must be convicted
by his own confession, to which they oblige him by force
of torture. The beauty of the city, which appears to a good advantage
by day light, is however not lost in the night, by means
of their new lamps, which are ranged in an orderly manner, stand
very close to each other, and are kept with great neatness. The gardens
of the principal gentlemen, and merchants here resident, are
without the fortifications; and being as well exceeding rich, as
beautified with great art, add a noble ornament to the place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> university is in a flourishing state, and has a true taste
of polite literature, especially as to philosophical studies. Tho I
know not whether they merit that character with regard to classical
learning. It is not now so numerous as formerly; because
<i>Hall</i>, which within these ten years has been erected into an university
by the King of <i>Prussia</i>, depriving them of their numbers,
has reduced them perhaps from three to one thousand students.
They have six colleges, called <i>Paulinum</i>, <i>Petrinum</i>, <i>Majorum</i> and
<i>Minorum Principum</i>, <i>Rubrum</i>, and <i>B. Mariae Virginis</i>. Each of
these have their <i>praepositus</i>, and some few stipends. But when
we mention academical colleges abroad, we must fall much below
the idea of those, with which we are so happily acquainted at
<i>Oxford</i> and <i>Cambridge</i>. In these colleges are their auditories, or
schools, of public lectures for philosophy, and the three superior
faculties. These are regularly taught by their respective professors,
of which the university is furnished with six in divinity, five in
law, four in physic, and nine in philosophy, humanity, and history.
Besides these, several of the more eminent doctors, and elder
students, have their private lectures, to which the younger resort
at their pleasure, and this with greater frequency and better success,
than to the lectures publicly established. The degrees in philosophy
are that of batchelor and master of arts; in the faculties,
of licentiate and doctor. Persons of note in the university, whom
I visited, were Dr. <i>Efficke</i> professor of divinity; and Dr. <i>Otto
Menchenius</i> professor of moral philosophy, who is likewise the editor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
of the <i>Acta Eruditorum</i>, of which I purchased an intire set
from the year 1682 to this present time, consisting of twenty five
volumes in <i>quarto</i>. Other eminent persons, with whom I had
a more frequent conversation, were Dr. <i>Goëtze</i>, Dr. <i>Menchenius
junior</i>, and Mr. <i>Olearius junior</i>. The two former are doctors of
law, and the latter professor of humanity. To these I may add
Mr. <i>Thomas Fritsel</i> bookseller, a person who has made an useful
tour over Europe; speaks several modern languages, as well as
Latin; and to whom I was obliged for a particular mark of
courtesy, and the present of several useful books. Not only he, but
the three gentlemen last mentioned speak good English, which
language is much esteemed and studied in this place. Dr. <i>Menchenius</i>
shewed me the little work of <i>Alcyonius De exilio</i>, which I
was glad to see, because it is said to have been compiled out of
<i>Cicero’s</i> treatise <i>De gloria</i>; which the plagiary for that reason took
occasion to suppress. Dr. <i>Goëtze</i> among several fair manuscripts,
and old editions of classic authors, shewed me a neat but antient
satyr <i>On the Pope and Court of Rome</i>. It is a manuscript, as
yet unprinted, in Elegiac verse, entitled <i>Eironeia Gaufridi</i>. He
has also a curious and fair manuscript of <i>Columella</i>, another
of a Greek <i>Menologion</i>, a very old <i>Greek Testament</i>, printed in
Spain, with the Latin in the margin; but exactly referring in
every word by cautious notes from the known to the unknown
language, lest the monks of that time should have taken
γενέσεως to signify <i>liber</i>, and βίβλος <i>generationis</i>. In another
old Spanish book, concerning the antiquities of that country,
he shewed me a copy of the old Gothic character; in which it is
observable, that the vowels are generally incorporated with the
consonants, which they follow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> the two libraries of this place, the one belonging to the university,
the other to the senate, I took notice of the following
curiosities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> the former I observed two celebrated pictures of <i>Luther</i> and
<i>Melancthon</i>, both taken after their death. Several specimens of
what they called <i>moneta bracteata</i>, lately found in Saxony; but
which I take to have been only leaves of silver covering a mass of
inferior metal. An old manuscript of <i>Homer</i>, with large <i>Scholia</i>,
which they here think have never been published. The draught
of an old <i>idol</i> worshiped in Germany; the original of which was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
a short brass image of an human figure, hollow within, and contrived
to make an artificial wind issue out of his mouth, like the
globes of that sort now become so common.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> the library of the senate I observed an Egyptian <i>mummy</i>.
Several Roman <i>urns</i> and <i>funeral lamps</i>. Saxon <i>urns</i>, like others
which I observed at <i>Dresden</i> and elsewhere, full of thin fragments
of bones; in one of which were found several small iron and brass
instruments, and upon a thin plate of brass the two following letters,
ⲱ. ⲉ. A fine collection of coins. A good manuscript of <i>Theocritus</i>.
A noble specimen of the rich silver mines in Saxony, in a mass
about three feet long and two broad, the whole of which almost is
pure metal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Adjoining</span> to the <i>Collegium Paulinum</i> is the university church,
where they have prayers on festival days. It is full of antient and
modern monuments, all of good work. This university took
its rise from the dispersion of the <i>Hussites</i>, and the banishment
of <i>John Huss</i> himself from <i>Prague</i>. And by its first constitution
it is appropriated to four nations; the <i>Misnians</i> (of whom <i>Leipsick</i>
is the metropolis) the other hereditary countries of the Elector of
<i>Saxony</i>, the <i>Bavarians</i>, and the <i>Poles</i>. The chief magistrate annually
elected here is called <i>rector magnificus</i>, as in other German
universities; and in him, with his subordinate officers, rests the sole
government and jurisdiction of this learned body. The present
<i>rector</i> is Dr. <i>Cyprianus</i>, professor of divinity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> was in <i>Leipsick</i>, that I first observed the Lutheran manner
of communicating. The priest and the deacon, who assists him,
are habited in surplices, copes, and sleeves, like those of the Greeks
and Romanists. The service is chanted by the priests standing, and
the people round about at a distance, but in the same posture.
The consecration being ended, the communicants draw near, and
on the north side of the altar approach the priest, who delivers into
the mouth of each of them still standing the consecrated wafer.
The communicants from thence walk round the back part of the
altar, and so come to the deacon, from whom they likewise standing
receive the cup, and thence return orderly to their proper
places. In the mean time, while the species are delivered by the
priest on one side and the deacon on the other, two choristers
habited likewise in copes and surplices attend each, holding under
them a rich pall of velvet, or other stuff, to receive any particle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
of the elements, which may fall accidentally. This done, they
likewise chant a thanksgiving service in a standing posture, and so
depart. The ecclesiastics of the place wear large white ruffs, not
only in time of divine service, but likewise as their ordinary habit
when in public; and with this a round cloth cap, like that
lately alloted to the commoners in the university of <i>Oxford</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">These</span> are the principal observations I had leisure to make at
<i>Leipsick</i>, where his Excellency staid from the sixth to the fourteenth
of this month. On this day therefore we proceed on our
journey five German miles to <i>Hall</i> over an open arable country.
This is an antient city, founded and perfected by the several
<i>Othos</i>, Emperors of Germany. It is now large, but meanly built,
tho famous for its salt pits, from whence it has the name of <i>Hall</i>.
In these they work night and day with an uninterrupted diligence,
nor ever cease, but in the time of divine service on Sundays. It
is situated on the river <i>Sala</i>, which name corresponds with that of
the city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> King of <i>Prussia</i>, as has been said, Sovereign of the place,
opened an university here some years since, which at present flourishes
with about a thousand students, and several professors of
eminent note, among these are <i>Strychius</i>, <i>Thomasius</i>, and <i>Franckius</i>.
The last is the person, who sent me formerly into Turkey several
little tracts of his own composition, which had been translated into
Latin and Italian, in order to be distributed here. I therefore
visited him this evening, and discoursed with him upon his
famous project of an ample charity; by which he maintains above
six hundred children of both sexes, and that by no other fund,
than collections gathered by his own industry. Three hundred
of these, being boys, he has reduced to a college, which he now
calls the <i>Orphanotrophium</i>. It is an handsome building, well contrived
for the reception of so many poor orphans, for their diet,
lodging, schooling, clothing, and afterwards their removal to some
proper calling. He has here a printing house for the use of the society,
and from thence have now been published several treatises,
of which he presented me with two, concerning the <i>Jewish</i> history,
and the ecclesiastical government of <i>Bohemia</i>. The King of <i>Prussia</i>,
who is thought the principal supporter of this great charity,
has lately authorized the <i>Orphanotrophium</i> under an ample patent,
and allowed both the society, and the founder of it, several honourable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
and advantageous privileges. By this great undertaking
Mr. <i>Franck</i> proposes to lay a scheme and foundation for the reformation
of manners, and better advancement of learning at the
same time. But as he is one of the primary <i>Pietists</i> in all Germany,
the opposite party among the Lutherans in these parts,
who in distinction call themselves the <i>Orthodox</i>, cease not to calumniate
both him and his design. Tho how justly, God only knows.
He delivered me a packet for Mr. <i>Ludolf</i>, and commissioned me
to salute Dr. <i>Bray</i>, and Mr. <i>Woodward</i> of <i>Stepney</i>, with whom he
corresponds in relation to this intended reformation.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">December</span> xv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">From</span> <i>Hall</i> we now pass to <i>Koendern</i>, and by the way cross
the <i>Sala</i> in a ferry boat at <i>Alsleber</i>, leaving <i>Eisleben</i>, the birth
place of <i>Luther</i>, a little on the right hand. The day following
we continue our journey from <i>Koendern</i> to <i>Aschersleben</i>, leaving
<i>Paidleburg</i> in sight on the left hand. And the next day we move
forward to <i>Halberstadt</i>, palling from <i>Upper</i> into <i>Lower Saxony</i>
in this day’s journey. <i>Halberstadt</i> is a large town, subject to the
King of <i>Prussia</i>, having about fourteen churches, which are pretty
equally divided betwixt Protestants and Papists.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">December</span> xviii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day we leave <i>Halberstadt</i> and proceed to <i>Hessen</i>, a small
village belonging to <i>Rodolphus Augustus</i>, Duke of <i>Brunswick</i>; who
has here an old moted house, with a pleasant garden, and a fountain
of brass work, which for the variety of animals there artfully
represented, and the device of the whole, deserves to be remarked.
We continue here the two following days, and then set out for
<i>Wolfembutel</i>, where we arrive at night, and lodge in the suburbs.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">December</span> xxii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">His</span> Excellency departed this morning from <i>Wolfembutel</i> with
a design to go directly to <i>Hildesheim</i>; upon which I desire leave
to take a different road, in order to see <i>Brunswick</i>, <i>Hanover</i>, and
<i>Hamburg</i>. However I spent this day at <i>Wolfembutel</i>, in observing
what was curious there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> town is pleasantly seated on the river <i>Ocker</i>, in a place not
so intirely level as the other parts of <i>Lower Saxony</i>, but enjoying a
variety of rising and declining ground, with a convenient mixture
of woods, which hitherto we observed to be intirely wanting from
<i>Leipsick</i> to this place. The city is compactly built, has fair and
large streets, tho no very stately edifices, and is well fortified
with a regular wall, and a double foss. It has two remarkable
churches, one of which is the cathedral, an old Gothic building,
adorned with a variety of sculpture and statues; and the other is
a new church, lately erected by the present Duke of this place,
in a peculiar form. It has an ascent at the front by a handsome
staircase on two sides, and then opens into a perfect oval, which
is supported by six stately pillars, and covered with a cupola.
Directly facing the door is a piece of good work in sculpture,
representing the <i>Virgin</i>, and other religious figures; and under
this in a small orbicular desk, which appears as an ornament of
the work, is seen the pulpit. Underneath is a table of wood, set
so distinct from the wall, that it cannot properly be called an altar,
and at each end are two high steps for the kneeling of the
communicants. For the Lutherans, who in some places communicate
standing, do the same in others kneeling; and the notion
of an altar, with the posture of receiving, are in their opinion
things indifferent. The castle of this place (which alone is properly
<i>Wolfembutel</i>) is just without the wall of the city, and is the
residence of the Duke. He has here an academy for the use of
young gentlemen of all nations, where they are instructed in the
arts of fencing, riding, dancing, and other exercises. But what
is most remarkable, in the precincts of the castle is the celebrated
library, founded by <i>Christianus Augustus</i>, the father of this Prince.
It consists of two large and spatious galleries, ranged all round
with books, and filled in the middle with a double row of desks,
which in the inner gallery likewise contain shelves for books of
lesser volumes. It was collected with great assiduity, and at a
vast expence, by the said Prince; who himself employed his pains
intirely in this design, and wrote the several catalogues digested
in various orders, and consisting of eight volumes in <i>folio</i>, with his
own hand. The present librarian is the famous Mr. <i>Leibnitz</i>, who
at this time did not reside upon the place; but an assistant of his
shewed the library, and observed to me the following curiosities.
A collection of printed <i>Bibles</i>, the largest and most curious, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
are any where to be found. A large manuscript <i>English Bible</i> in
<i>folio</i>, which seems very antient and begins thus: <i>In the erste made
God of nought the hevens and the ery, and the ery forsooth was vein
and veyd, and darknesses weren upon the face of the zee.</i> At the
bottom of the first page is wrote <i>Lumley</i> in later characters. A
manuscript <i>Greek Testament</i>; and two printed copies, one of <i>Aldus</i>
and the other at <i>Hagenoa</i>, in which is wanting that famous
testimony of <i>St. John</i> concerning the three, that bear witness in
heaven. An antient manuscript of <i>St. Jerome’s Bible</i>, written
about four hundred years since, by one who subscribes himself
<i>Abbas Gaufridus Vitulus</i>; and at the end of the same has delineated
himself, with the head of a <i>calf</i>. A manuscript <i>Aethiopic Testament</i>,
given by father <i>Kircher</i> to the founder of the library. A
copy of the <i>Psalms</i>, written in those characters, which are called
<i>Ciceroniani</i> and <i>Cyprianici</i>. A voluminous collection of modern
<i>Histories</i>, in four hundred manuscript volumes in <i>folio</i>; among
which are thirteen called <i>Chroniques d’Angleterre</i>. The whole
number cost the Duke two thousand four hundred crowns; but
it is thought, he purchased them much to dear. A fair turning
desk with six leaves, like that before described in the Praemonstratensian
library at <i>Prague</i>. A fair <i>Herbal</i>, with each flower delineated
in its proper colours. A roll of the <i>Pentateuch</i>, and a
vail now used by the Jews in reading the <i>Law</i>. Several reliques of
<i>Luther</i>, as his spoon, drinking glass, leaden inkbottle, and a <i>Letter</i>
in his own hand to one of his contemporary bishops, in which
he sends the salutes of his wife in these words: <i>Salutat te, Dominus
meus, Ketha reverenter.</i> Two books written by Prince <i>Christian</i>
himself, founder of the library: one <i>De ludo scacchia</i>, in the
German language; the other in <i>folio</i>, called <i>Cryptographia</i>, treating
of cyphers and other secret devices, in the title of which he
calls himself <i>Gustavus Selenus</i>, meaning <i>Augustus Luneburgicus</i>.
A fair edition of the <i>vulgate Latin Bible</i> by <i>Aldus</i> at <i>Venice</i>, which
reads in <i>Genesis</i> iii. 15, <i>Ipsum conteret caput tuum</i>, instead of the
usual <i>ipsa</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> present Duke <i>Antonius Ulricus</i>, and his brother <i>Rudolphus
Augustus</i>, who resides at <i>Brunswick</i>, have the title of <i>Brunswick</i>
and <i>Lunenburg</i> in common with their eldest brother the Duke
of <i>Zell</i>, and their nephew the Duke of <i>Hanover</i>. But their proper
government is the territory of <i>Brunswick</i> and <i>Wolfembutel</i>
which they govern by joint name and authority, both being equally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
sovereign in each. <i>Rudolphus</i> is about seventy two years of age,
plain and unaffected in his carriage, insomuch that sometimes he
takes a private journey to <i>Hamburg</i> where he walks the streets
in the disguise of a country gentleman. But <i>Antonius</i> is a more
polite and accomplished prince, affecting the French behaviour
and education; for which end he here maintains the academy
above mentioned He is courtly, and condescending, and greatly beloved
by his subjects. He is now about sixty three years of age, and
has two sons; of which he, who shall live to be his heir, will
jointly inherit the authority and dominions both of his father and
uncle <i>Rudolphus</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">December</span> xxiii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> morning I take the post waggon for <i>Brunswick</i>, which is
seated on the same river as <i>Wolfembutel</i>, in a watry plain, having
a large extent, but narrow streets, and houses of the old fashion
almost intirely of wood, most of which have a date over the door
of three or four hundred years standing. The stadthouse is of
the same or greater antiquity, and adorned with a variety of statues
on the outside. The town is fortified, but neither with great
regularity nor strength. The castle is the residence of the Duke,
being an old decayed building. I staid here from nine in the
morning till three in the afternoon, where I found the mum, for
which this place is so celebrated, not so good, as that they
export for sale. It is made only of malt well brewed, and the
liquor boiled a second time in an equal quantity of the same.
However the art is peculiar to this place, and cannot be imitated
at <i>Wolfembutel</i>, tho it is so very near. Nor, on the other hand, can
the excellent beer of <i>Wolfembutel</i> be equal’d here. They are
likewise famous for a large sort of sausage, which is made of raw
meat and spices.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">At</span> three a clock I depart for <i>Hanover</i> by the way of <i>Peine</i>,
with an intention, as is here the custom, to travel all night. In the
way betwixt seven and eight a clock (which at this time of the year
had been entirely dark, unless for the benefit of the moon) the
post horses tired in an open feild, and refused to stir a step farther;
by which means we were detained above an hour, till the
postilion procured others from a neighbouring village. I was
then in company of an Italian man and a French woman, whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
company somewhat relieved the affliction of this accident. By
twelve a clock we reach <i>Peine</i>, and after half an hour’s refreshment
the Italian and I proceed for <i>Hanover</i>, thro a wide and
watry common.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">December</span> xxiv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> eight a clock this morning I arrive at <i>Hanover</i>, where I
wait on Mr. <i>Cresset</i>, and his chaplain Mr. <i>Lombard</i>. And being
invited by the former to diner, we no sooner rise from table, but
news was brought, that my Lord Paget, having changed his mind,
had turned out of the road for <i>Heldesheim</i> to this place; to whom
therefore I repair at his lodgings without the gate of the city.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">December</span> xxv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Tho</span> this was <i>Christmas</i> day, his Excellency had nevertheless
no service in his family. And the day following I made a visit to
Mr. Scott, Sir Chumley Deering, Mr. Wright, and some others.
The next day being Sunday, his Excellency had service in his family.
At five a clock in the evening I was introduced by Mr. Scott,
and lady Belmont, to kiss the hand of the Princess Dowager <i>Sophía</i>,
who did me the honour to discourse with me half an hour about
the state of Turkey. The same night a tragedy was acted at the
theatre of the court, and afterwards the <i>Mariage forcé</i> of <i>Moliere</i>;
which I then saw, for the opportunity of seeing at the same time
the Prince Elector, the Prince his son, and the Princess his daughter,
with the Electress Dowager, who were all present.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">December</span> xxviii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">His</span> Excellency proceeds in his way to <i>Osnaburg</i>; but I continue
still at <i>Hanover</i>, with an intention to take post for <i>Hamburg</i>,
and dine this day with Mr. <i>Cresset</i>. The day following in the
afternoon I visit the library and cabinet of Abbot <i>Gerhardus</i>, otherwise
called <i>Molanus</i>. His cabinet consists of a vast collection of
modern coins, particularly those of Germany, among which he
has intire sets of the houses of <i>Brunswick</i> and <i>Saxony</i>. He has
likewise a rich and numerous collection of medals of all the European
kingdoms, stampt upon the most celebrated occasions;
and many of them are gold, some of which weigh an hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
ducats, and others but little less. Those of <i>Sweden</i> seemed
to me the noblest both for the work and device, particularly one
of <i>Gustavus Adolphus</i>, upon marching his army over the frozen
<i>Baltick</i>, with this inscription: <span class="smcap gesperrt">NATURA HOC DEBVIT VNI</span>. Another
of <i>Charles</i> the eleventh, with the reverse of the <i>North star</i>,
and inscribed: <span class="smcap gesperrt">NESCIT OCCASVM</span>. Those of the house of <i>Hanover</i>
are likewise curious, particularly one of the Princess Dowager,
stampt by her about fourteen years since; the reverse a <i>sun</i>
setting without a cloud, and the words: <i>Senza turbarmi al fin
m’accosto.</i> Another of the young Prince <i>George Augustus</i>, the reverse
a <i>fountain</i> springing up in a strong perpendicular column of
water, with this legend: <span class="smcap gesperrt">VIS INSITA DVCIT IN ALTVM</span>. Besides
these he has a good collection of antient medals; the most remarkable
of which were <i>Julianus</i> the first; and <i>Antinous</i> of the
first size, if genuine, the reverse a <i>sheep</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> eleven a clock this night I depart in the post waggon for
<i>Zell</i>, and in the way make these observations on <i>Hanover</i>, and
the persons I saw there. The town is moderately large, fair, and
compact, seated on the <i>Leine</i>, and reasonably well fortified. The
palace of the Prince is old, and mean in outward appearance, but
within beautiful and splendid. The clergy here is but meanly
esteemed, and more meanly provided for; except that Abbot
<i>Gerhardus</i> has an income (the sole remainder of church lands not
sequestered) to the yearly value of eight hundred pounds sterling.
By this preferment he is superintendent of the whole clergy in the
territories of the Duke of <i>Brunswick Hanover</i>, and is by the same
incapable of marrying. The Elector is a sage, discreet, just, and
sober Prince. The Princess his mother is courteous, affable, condescending,
and prudent; well versed in the Dutch, English,
French, and Italian languages; and gay and vigorous to a miracle
at the age of seventy two. The young Prince is brisk, affable,
and ingenious. The Princess, daughter to the Elector, comely,
ingenious, lively, and her courteous behaviour charms all, who
converse with her. Mr. <i>Cresset</i>, who has long resided as Envoy
to this court, and those of <i>Zell</i>, <i>Brunswick</i>, and <i>Wolfembutel</i>, is a
wise and pious gentleman, has a family well governed, and lives
much to the honour of himself and his country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">December</span> xxx.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> seven a clock this morning I arrive at <i>Zell</i>, where I remain
the rest of the day, and take that opportunity of seeing the
castle; as likewise the venerable old Duke, <i>William George</i>, now
eighty years of age; to whom I was admitted by the favour of Mr.
<i>Robbeton</i> and Mr. <i>De la Forest</i>, two gentlemen who here shewed
me great civility.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">December</span> xxxi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">I set</span> forward from <i>Zell</i>, and lodge this night at a post house,
in a small village called <i>Sorndorf</i>. The country is here pleasant,
with a variety of fir, oak, and other wood, but for the most part
barren, and overrun, with heath.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">January</span> i.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">From</span> <i>Sorndorf</i> I reach <i>Harburg</i> by twelve a clock this day,
dine there, and then take boat for <i>Hamburg</i> cross the <i>Elbe</i>.
The river is here above a German mile broad, and interspersed
with various islands. In the evening I delivered Mr. <i>Cresset’s</i> recommendations
to Mr. Aldersey, who thereupon received me courteously,
and procured me a good lodging from Mr. Townly in the
English house. I was detained here to the twenty eighth of this
month, partly by the extremity of the frost, which had made the
<i>Elbe</i> now unpassable; and partly by the kindness of our English
merchants, who reside in this place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Hamburg</span> is a free imperial city, chief of the <i>Hanse</i> towns,
and seated on the north side of the <i>Elbe</i>, where it receives the
<i>Alster</i>. The figure of it is semicircular, being almost straight towards
the <i>Elbe</i>, which it receives by many chanels into the very
heart of the city. Some of these chanels serve as harbours to the
ships, others to convey goods to the magazines of merchants, and
others to bring water to the houses, particularly of the brewers,
who have cranes to draw water into their vessels. It is about two
Italian miles in length, and above five in circumference. The
streets are well paved, tho narrow, and the houses beautiful in the
front, especially in the <i>Wantrum</i>, the <i>Green</i>, and <i>Catherine</i> street.
The fortifications are substantial, consisting intirely of ramparts of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
earth, covered with grass, and not faced with brick. They are
constantly maintained in good repair; tho it is commonly objected
to them, that the inward works are too high, so that being
raised too much above the outward, they are exposed to the first
attack of the enemy. There are six gates, all beautiful and stately
buildings; that particularly, which is called the gate of <i>Altena</i>,
because it leads to that place, is said to have cost an hundred
thousand crowns. The strength of the city was lately tried, in the
year 1686 (If I mistake not) by the King of <i>Denmark</i>, who then
laid siege to it, tho without success. He had depended upon
the treachery of two principal burgers, who had promised to admit
him into the town; but their treason being accidentally detected,
and they put to the torture, the matter was soon confessed,
and they deservedly executed. The head of one of them is still
exposed on an iron Spike over the <i>Steingate</i>. In confidence of this
concerted treachery that Prince came so unprovided, that he could
invest no more of the town, than that which faces <i>Altena</i> which
gave occasion to the Holland <i>gazeteer</i> to say, that the King of
<i>Denmark</i> had besieged the eighth part of <i>Hamburg</i>. During the
siege he was baffled even by the small castle, called <i>Sternfort</i>,
about a mile distant from the town; which by a line of communication
they releived every day at twelve a clock, and so maintained
it against the enemy. To add to the strength of the city
they are now building a new detached work, consisting of an intire
rampart, to be continued from the east side of the <i>Alster</i> to
the <i>Elbe</i>, which is a noble fortification, and will at the same time
guard and enlarge the space of the city. It is divided into the
<i>New</i> and the <i>Old City</i>, the former of which is the more stately
and beautiful of the two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> religion of this place is Lutheran, in which the government
is so strict, as to admit of no other religious assembly, except
that of the church of England, which is allowed to the English
company. The city is divided into five parishes, that of <i>St.
Catharine</i>, <i>St. Peter</i>, <i>St. James</i>, <i>St. Nicholas</i>, and <i>St. John</i>. To
each of these are dedicated so many fair and spatious churches, all
well adorned with sculptures, paintings, organs, and altars. That
of <i>St. Catharine</i> exceeds the rest, and is particularly remarkable
for a noble stone pulpit, the whole consisting of the bed marble,
carved into the figures of the twelve <i>Apostles</i>, and other religious
devices; for several large inimitable pieces of painting in <i>fresco</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
against the north wall; and for a stately organ, supposed to be
the largest and finest in the world. It has fifty four stops, and
consists of five thousand pipes, all gradually proportioned from
the biggest, which is three fourths of an English yard in diameter,
to the least, no larger than the last joint of ones little finger. In
the same church is admirably well painted the <i>Temple of Solomon</i>
in perspective. Besides these parish churches, there is the cathedral,
commonly there called the <i>Dome</i>; and a new church in the middle
of the <i>New City</i>. The <i>Dome</i> is now almost out of use, except for
some occasional sermons; and the porch, with the several isles, are
possessed by booksellers shops: tho this is what is likewise common
to the porches, and other outward apartments, of the most frequented
churches. The five parish churches, and that of the <i>New
City</i>, have each of them their pastor, and besides him two or three
chaplains; so that the number of clergymen here amounts to above
twenty, of which one is superintendant over them, and the clergy
of the whole territory. This however is very small, as not reaching
down the river <i>Elbe</i> farther than the limits of <i>Altena</i>, a
large town within half a mile of <i>Hamburg</i>, belonging to the King
of <i>Denmark</i>. On the other sides it is encompassed with the dominions
of the Duke of <i>Holstein</i>, at the distance of two or three
miles; only up the <i>Elbe</i> it has a narrow tract of ground subject to
the city, for the space of twenty miles, in which are some small
villages, that acknowledge its jurisdiction. The church lands belonging
to the cathedral are now possessed by burgers, or others
of the city; but under the same titles, by which they formerly belonged
to the church, as <i>dean</i>, <i>canons</i>, and others. Which sequestration,
as it seems to be a sacrilegious usurpation; so their continuing
the right under the same titles, is only a monument and
confession of the crime.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> government of the city is by a free and sovereign jurisdiction
of their own, which is lodged in three orders of men, the
burgomasters, the senate, and the burgers. The burgomasters
are four persons chosen out of the senate, of which two are
yearly regent. The senate consists of about twenty, chosen as
vacancies happen out of the burgers. The burgers compose the
whole body of the citizens, ranked under their five distinct parishes.
This government some what resembles that of antient <i>Rome</i>, by
consuls, senate, and people; and is excellent in itself, but very
liable to be perverted by the prevalency of any of the parts, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
which it consists. This is at present seen in the case of <i>Hamburg</i>,
where the burgers by reason of their multitude, and the seditious
spirit of inferior persons, have so far usurped the power of
the place, that they terrify the senate, and stop all public proceedings,
which are not to their relish. Particularly they are now
so obstinate, as to refuse their consent to the supply towards the
war, required by the Emperor, and to other public levies of the
city, till they can extort the consent of the senate for restoring
one Dr. <i>Meyer</i> to his pastoral office of <i>St James</i>. This is a violent
seditious man, suspected of an ill life, but of a ready overbearing
eloquence in the pulpit; who, about five years since had quitted
his pastoral office in <i>Hamburg</i>, for another like charge, and superintendency
in <i>Pomerania</i>. His parishioners now recall him to
his cure at <i>Hamburg</i>, which he publicly declines; but privately
encourages, and thereby occasions a lamentable faction and sedition
in the town. His own and two other parishes press his return,
and refuse to treat of other business, till the senate shall consent
thereto. But they being duly cautious of admitting so dangerous
a person into the city, who is now more particularly suspected of
intriguing against them, in dependence on the King of Sweden,
will never admit thereof; especially as he insists upon returning
in his own rank, and in prospect of the same seniority, he before
obtained in the place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> burgomasters of this place never appear in public, but
in a peculiar dress; which consists of an high crowned hat made
of cloth, plated thick and strong in numerous folds; with a
large ruff; and a black velvet coat ending at the knees, and plaited
from the middle. There are likewise several other antient habits
used by all public persons, even to midwives, dressers of the
dead, and those who bear the corps to funerals. The habit of
their divines is a round black cap, a ruff, and a gown without
sleeves. All these may commonly be seen at once in the solemnity
of a funeral, which they here affect to make very pompous
for all persons, even those of little children. The burgomasters,
senators, divines, lawyers, physicians, and as many of all
sorts, as they can procure, attend the corps from the house to the
church; for which they are each paid a certain fee, the chief about
a florin, and inferiors proportionably. It is observable, that the
bearers of the corps have a peculiar step, all moving their leg at
the same time croswise from one side to the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> city wholly subsists by trade, which it still enjoys to a great
degree. But they now complain, that they begin to be robbed of
their former flourishing commerce by <i>Lubeck</i> and <i>Bremen</i>, and
even the poor town of <i>Altena</i>, which with regret they see rising
under their walls. Here is the staple of linen from Germany;
cloth from England; and wines from Spain, France, and the
Rhine. Of this last the city preserves a vast stock in public
cellars; the largest of which, being a magazine of <i>Rhenish</i> wine, I
visited one evening, and was there assured, that they have the
wine of every year since 1623; and accordingly we then drank
of three sorts, 1623, 1664, and 1678. At the same time I
tried the perfect clearness of the loaf sugar of this place; which
they purify to such a degree, that it does not discolour the cleared

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> English company, which upon the decay of <i>Antwerp</i>
removed to this place, is a regular, gentile, and hospitable society
of merchants. They were here granted large privileges, which they
still enjoy; tho at home our English parliament has lately infringed
those, which they had permitted them. Their goods from England
are imported free of custom, except that they pay a trifle as an
acknowledgement. Their own jurisdiction, and religion, is freely
granted them. The town first presented them with a large piece
of building, which they obliged themselves to keep in perpetual
repair. In this there is a public chapel; and an apartment, which
they call the <i>Ordinary room</i>, where all the company, who are unmarried,
dine and sup at one table, and the deputy governor and
assistants meet upon public occasions. Adjoining to it is the house
of the deputy governor, the minister, and the secretary; all likewise
given by the town, and maintained by them. The governor
of this company at present resides in England; but the other
officers, as the deputy governor, secretary, and assistants, to the
number of twenty four, are all resident upon the place, and dispatch
all business relating to the society; which is contrary to the
custom of the Turkey company, the governing part whereof always
resides in England. The deputy governor and secretary are chosen,
or confirmed, either quarterly or yearly; and the same is practised
with the minister, whose salary, besides the benefit of an house,
is two hundred pounds a year. The number of merchants, assistants,
and others, may here amount from thirty to forty persons;
and with their wives, children, and servants, their congregation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
(which is very regular) is seen on Sunday from an hundred and
fifty to two hundred persons. My conversation during my stay
at <i>Hamburg</i> was chiefly among these; and I had more particularly
the friendship of Mr. Free, deputy governor; Mr. Aldersey,
secretary; Mr. Emerson, minister; Mr. Stratford, Manning, Lethieullier,
and Remington merchants; and their respective families.
I preached every Sunday, while I continued here; and received
many tokens of favour from the whole company; particularly on
the sixteenth of January, a present of a silver tankard, value forty
crowns. At the same time I had the honour of being known to Mr.
Wyat, her Majesty’s resident at this place, and deputed likewise
to the <i>Hanse</i> towns of <i>Bremen</i> and <i>Lubeck</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">There</span> is a good and well furnished library belonging to this
city, which adjoins to the church of <i>St. John</i>. And during my
stay here I had the opportunity of conversing with <i>Jo. Albertus
Fabricius</i>, a person of great learning, and famous for some works
he has already published. I visited likewise <i>Mynhéer Langerman</i>, a
druggist, who shewed me some curious <i>ores</i>; and <i>pieces of eight</i>,
fished up from a Spanish wreck; with the <i>piedra de puerco</i>, about
the size of a large nutmeg, which is found in the bladder of some
hogs in the <i>Philippine</i> islands, a great sudorific, and esteemed a
sovereign remedy against intermitting fevers. One stone is usually
valued at a hundred ducats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> night I visited the wine cellar at Mr. Manning’s house,
we saw a man, named <i>George Po</i>, born at <i>Prague</i>, who eat raw
flesh, glass, paper, and above all things raw flax and tow, which
he devoured very greedily, and called it his chief delicacy. He
likewise swallows large stones, and accustoms himself to devour all
unnatural substances, even perukes; tho of this last he is now
somewhat cautious, since his twin brother died by eating one at
<i>Halberstadt</i>. A senator’s wife of this city maintains an opera house,
where they have a prodigious large stage, and great variety of
well painted scenes. Here Mr. Lethieullier one night entertained
us to our great satisfaction. At the same place, and belonging to
the same woman, is shewn the famous model of <i>Solomon’s Temple</i>,
being the exact resemblance of that fabric, as described by the best
authors, expressed in every part by carved wood work to the hight
of an English yard, and all the inward apartments perfectly exhibited
to the eye, as the workman takes it to pieces for the satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
of the spectators. This ingenious machine cost no less
than ten thousand dollars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> inhabitants of <i>Hamburg</i> are censured as proud, formal,
and ceremonious; the magistrates as addicted to vice, libertinism,
and self interest; and the people as turbulent, and seditious;
whence many prognosticate ill to the trade, and future power of
the city. The language, which they here speak, is called the
<i>Plat Dutch</i>, being a medium betwixt that of Germany and Holland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">During</span> my stay here, I was informed of a detestable practice,
frequent among many melancholy and disordered persons of this
place; who being weary of life, and apprehensive of the sin of
self murder, rather choose to murder some innocent child, and
by that means to be brought to capital punishment, by which they
attain their desire of death, with the advantage, as they imagine,
of a previous time for repentance, without the guilt of their own
hand. At the same time they esteem the child, whom they choose
to sacrifice, to be without any guilt of conscience, as having not
yet arrived to years of discretion<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>. This tragedy happens every
year, as many experienced witnesses among our merchants assured
me; and they attribute the frequency of the practice to the great
facility of their confessors, in affording peace and fair promises to
all sorts of dying penitents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Another</span> tragedy lately acted at <i>Hamburg</i> was of a monstrous
virago, born in the dukedom of <i>Zell</i>, who by an unnatural disposition
of her uterine parts was capable of acting the part of a
man; and accordingly she made it her practice in rambling from
place to place to marry at each a young woman, several of whom
she had murdered. With her last spouse, whom she had let into
all her mysterious impiety, she murdered one of her former wives;
as likewise a man, whom they had cajoled for sometime into their
company, and whose head they afterwards boiled for venefical uses,
as they pretended. But being caught and tortured, they confessed
this black history of their life, and were executed here about a
year since.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> campain about the neighbourhood of <i>Hamburg</i> is green,
and well distinguished with wood and shade; but at a farther<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
distance, like other parts of <i>Lower Saxony</i>, it is a dull and unfruitful
heath. The immediate circuit of the walls affords delicious
walks, all kept in good repair, and adorned on each side
with rows of trees, kept in a beautiful order. Sometime after we
had received the account of the capture of the Spanish galleons at
<i>Vigo</i>, happening to have a leisure hour, I amused myself in writing
the following short poem upon that agreable subject.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">January</span> xxviii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Resolving</span> at last to take leave of my good friends at <i>Hamburg</i>,
<i>Mynhéer Platia</i>, with two other merchants, and myself,
hire a post waggon for <i>Holland</i>. We set forward by seven a clock
in the morning, and continue our way two German miles up the
river, by the village of <i>Offensey</i> to <i>Blankeness</i>; there we cross the
<i>Elbe</i>, and proceed to a town called <i>Buxtchude</i> in the dominion of
<i>Sweden</i>, and by night arrive at a poor house in the wood called
<i>Arnswoldt</i>. Here we drive in with our waggon, and alight at the
same room, which was to receive us and our horses, and be at the
same time our chamber and parlour, and the kitchin of our old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
landlady, who was smoked like a ham of bacon. We found her
with her houshold, brooding over a fire hearth in the middle of
this apartment, common to her self and cattle. Over which there
was no chimney, but a wooden rack well stored with bacon,
where the smoke was employed to prepare the provision of the
year, without wasting itself at the funnel of a chimney. We are
laid on a large heap of straw<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>, whilst the cows are chewing the
cud on each side, and lulling us to sleep. It was here I first saw
the black bread of this country, called <i>bonpournickel</i>; and was told,
that this with plenty of swines flesh, and the thick water of this
flat country, were the only dainties of the place. However, it
was our good fortune not to be reduced to that diet; for we
fared well on our hamper, which we brought with us from <i>Hamburg</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">January</span> xxix.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Leaving</span> this disagreable place very early, we arrive at the
gates of <i>Bremen</i> late at night, and are therefore obliged to lodge in
the suburbs, till we could enter the town the next morning. It
is a large and fair city, free of the empire, and one of the most
considerable <i>Hanse</i> towns, seated on the <i>Weser</i>, or <i>Visurgis</i>. Here
we baited at the wine cellar over against the Exchange, where
there is a magazine of good <i>Rhenish</i>, inferior in nothing but the
quantity of vessels, and largeness of the stock, to that of <i>Hamburg</i>.
We then proceed by nine a clock (after I had visited Mr.
Willet, an English merchant) and on the farther side of the town
cross the river under a noble gate, which in an inscription calls
this VETVSTISSIMVS VISVRGIS TRAIECTVS. The <i>Weser</i> is here fair,
wide, and almost straight, affording a reception for the vessels belonging
to the town; but those of a greater burthen are obliged
to remain some leagues lower. At this river we now leave <i>Lower
Saxony</i>, and enter the circle of <i>Westphalia</i>. In an hour and a half
we come to <i>Delmenhorst</i>, an old town and castle belonging to the
King of <i>Denmark</i>. From thence we proceed to <i>Wildeshusen</i>, a
town in the dominion of the Elector of <i>Hanover</i>, where we
lodge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">January</span> xxxi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> go on this day to <i>Klopperburg</i>, a town of the <i>Lower Bishoprick</i>
of <i>Munster</i>; from whence in a little time we reach the banks
of the <i>Hase</i>, and in a few hours more the town thence called
<i>Haselun</i>, where we take up our lodging that night.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">February</span> i.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> had hitherto found <i>Westphalia</i> a desolate and wild country,
overrun with heath, except here and there adorned with
small groves of stately oak, in the middle of which we commonly
found a single farm house, enclosed with rude pales like a
park, which in summer time must be truly pleasant. In several
places by the road side are seen posts, with iron boxes on the top,
for the receipt of charity, as if the land it self confessed its poverty.
However in this day’s journey the appearance began to
alter, for about ten a clock we arrived at <i>Lingen</i>, a pretty compact
and well built town, which lately belonged to King <i>William</i>, but
now to the King of <i>Prussia</i>. The neighbourhood is well stored
with woods; the skirts of the town adorned with frequent gardens,
and alleys of trees orderly planted; and the whole place by a show
of riches and beauty confessing, as it were, the benefit of a moderate
and protestant government.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Just</span> beyond the limits of this town we cross the <i>Ems</i>, or
<i>Amasia</i>, by a ferry boat, and afterwards continue our journey to
<i>Northern</i>, the first town of the <i>United Provinces</i>, in the limits of
which we now pass out of <i>Westphalia</i> into <i>Overissel</i>. After a
short bait we proceed to <i>Otmarsh</i>, and there lodge. This is the
first place, since I left <i>Hamburg</i>, where I was offered a bed, having
hitherto slept in my cloaths upon the straw.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">February</span> ii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> now proceed by the way of <i>Almeloo</i>, and so to <i>Deventer</i>,
over the plains, where his late Majesty delighted sometimes to
hunt. These plains are covered with heath, and therefore afford not
so good riding; but at the same time they are enclosed within long
tracts of hills rising gently, which give the sportsman a convenient
sight of the chase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">February</span> iii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> stop this day at <i>Deventer</i>, and put up at a public inn,
where we dine with some Danish officers; and after diner I pay
a visit to the learned <i>Gisbertus Cuperus</i>, who entertained me very
obligingly, shewed me his library, coins, inscriptions, and other
curiosities. In his library were several large volumes of letters,
written by him in the name of the states, or on other public occasions.
Among his coins was one with the title of <span class="smcap gesperrt">IMP. VNICVS</span>.
And among his inscriptions this which follows:</p>

<div class="inscription-container">
<div class="inscription">
<div class="line-l">MACSVSANO HERCVLI SACRVM</div>
<div class="line-l">FLAVIVS SVMMVS MAGISTRATVS</div>

<p class="noindent">He seemed to think this was <i>Hercules</i> of <i>Mackshusen</i>, a town not
far distant from hence. I continue the following day at <i>Deventer</i>,
and from thence write to my freinds at <i>Hamburg</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">February</span> v.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">From</span> <i>Deventer</i> I now proceed in three hours to <i>Loo</i>, where I
was entertained for some hours in viewing the house and gardens
of his late Majesty, and then go forward to a village called <i>Fortshausen</i>,
where I take up my lodging. The next day I continue
my journey to <i>Amersford</i>, where I dine, and by four a clock reach
<i>Utrecht</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">February</span> vii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> and the two following days I remain at <i>Utrecht</i>, where I
now first visit, and contract a very agreable acquaintance with
Mr. <i>Paul Foley</i>, student of that university; who the day after
obliged me with his company in a <i>treck schuyt</i> to <i>Leyden</i>, where I
view the physic garden, and adjoining galleries of natural rarities;
the academy, anatomy theatre, great church, and other curiosities
of the place. And the next morning I take the like passage for
<i>Rotterdam</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">February</span> xii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day I went to the <i>Hague</i>, where at length I again met
his Excellency; having seen <i>Delft</i> and <i>Ryswick</i> in the way. At<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
<i>Delft</i> particularly I was entertained with a sight of the great
church, and fine monument erected there in memory of <i>William</i>
the first, Prince of <i>Orange</i>. And the next day I continue to attend
his Excellency at the <i>Hague</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">February</span> xiv.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> day, being Sunday, I depart from the <i>Hague</i>, with his
Excellency, Mr. Paget, and Mr. Foley, in a <i>treck schuyt</i>, by the way
of <i>Leyden</i>, for <i>Amsterdam</i>; where we put up at the <i>Oude Heeren
logement</i>. And staying here the two following days, after paying
a visit to Mr. <i>Marcus</i>, I amuse myself with viewing the
magazine of the admiralty, the stadthouse, and spinhouse; the
hospital of boys and girls, with that of old women; the rasphouse,
and other public buildings.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">February</span> xviii.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">I return</span> this day to <i>Leyden</i>, and there see Mr. <i>De la Faye</i>,
brother of the English minister of that place; and with him visit
<i>Jacobus Gronovius</i>, professor of eloquence and history, and at this
time <i>rector magnificus</i>; from whom I receive a copy of <i>Mynhéer
Cosson’s</i> inscriptions, among which are some not published in the
<i>Memoria Cossoniana</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">February</span> xix.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> now leave <i>Leyden</i>, and go back to <i>Rotterdam</i>, where his
Excellency is lodged at the <i>Doole</i> for about eight days, and then
removes to <i>Winestreet</i>. During this time I become acquainted
with Mr. Richard Davis on the <i>Heering vliet</i>, the chief promoter
of the new episcopal English church, now building at the upper
end of that <i>vliet</i>. I observe whatever is remarkable here, particularly
the statue of <i>Erasmus</i>, and the house of his birth; and
likewise pay a visit to <i>Mons. Bayle</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">March</span> vi.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">I attend</span> his Excellency to the <i>Hague</i>, and the next day, being
Sunday, I go to <i>Rotterdam</i>, there preach to the episcopal congregation,
and return to the <i>Hague</i> that evening. The day following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
I walk from thence to the <i>House</i> in the wood, which is a
fine summer retirement, neatly built, and furnished with good
painting, by <i>Frederic Henry</i>, Prince of <i>Orange</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap gesperrt">March</span> x.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">I depart</span> with Dr. <i>Timeni</i> for <i>Leyden</i>, where I now propose a
long stay. And here I contract an acquaintance with Mr. <i>Neufville</i>,
an ingenious and polite gentleman, master of a good library,
and a curious collection of antiquities. With him also and Dr.
<i>Timeni</i> I visit several of the professors, as <i>Gronovius</i>, <i>Perizonius</i>,
and <i>Triglandius</i>; and see likewise the library, and especially the
manuscripts of this university. Among other curiosities in the

I pass on to <i>Honstardyke</i>, where I see the <i>orangery</i> four
hundred and fifty yards long; the East India <i>buffalo</i>, male and
female; the aviary, in which is a white peacock, the birds called
<i>lepelaars</i>, and variety of foreign ducks and geese; the stable of foreign

<i>Geographical Charts</i>, both <i>Old</i> and <i>New</i>; and then visit <i>Mynhéer
Uilenbroek</i>, a curious gentleman, possessed of a very large and well
chosen library, as also a cabinet of coins and other rarities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">I depart</span> for <i>Harlem</i>, and there visit the learned <i>Antony Van

me very obligingly with a sight of the neat gardens, costly
tulips, and other amusements of that place. In discoursing with
him on divers subjects of learning, he seemed in some things over
sceptical, questioning particularly the authority of the <i>Apocalypse</i>.

named <i>Hester</i>, about seventeen years of age, born deaf and consequently
dumb; but taught to speak (tho not very articulately) by
one Dr. <i>Amman</i>, who has published a book upon that art, of which
the young lady gave me a copy in <i>Dutch</i>, and her father another
in <i>Latin</i>. She asked me after Mr. <i>Rombouts</i> of <i>Constantinople</i>;
and I answering he is dead, she discerned what I said by the motion
of my lips. By the same means she can discourse at large with
her mother even in the dark, by feeling her lips when speaking.
She writes well, and paints curiously. And her mother is an excellent
Latinist. The same day Mr. <i>Van Dale</i> shewed me a specimen
of the first printing, kept in the town house of this place;
and in the market place the inscription, asserting that invention

with Mr. <i>Vandeput</i>, I review the cabinet of <i>Mynhéer Uilenbroek</i>;

remarkable for the corruption of the language.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap gesperrt">Reverend Sir</span>,</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Your</span> great goodness will excuse the tardiness of this letter,
when I assure you, that I have been long ambitious of collecting
any thing, that might deserve your notice; tho hitherto I
have been successless in that desire. Many things indeed have
occurred observable to me; but I could not hope at the same time,
that they might appear such to you. For it is common with unexperienced
travelers to be transported with pleasure and admiration,
when their accounts are not able to raise the same affections
in their freinds; either because they converse with men of better
judgment, or because the most valuable relations must needs be
heard with a greater coldness, than the things were seen. But notwithstanding
these discouragements, I have lately looked back upon
my <i>Journal</i>, to see if any thing might there appear remarkable
at this distance; and tho a short voyage by sea must be barren of
all real curiosity, yet for the subject of this letter I shall now
trouble you with some of the things, which I observed at <i>Cadiz</i>,
<i>Messina</i>, and <i>Milo</i>, the three only places, where we touched in
our passage hither.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> <i>Cadiz</i>, as in most other parts of the Spanish dominions, there
is nothing very curious, but in their churches or convents; and
this, when once seen, is to be deplored, rather than admired. For
when you first come into the town, you are not so much struck
with a face of religion, as with the notion of a certain politic
game, where the priests are soon discovered to be the only winners.
Since in the whole place there is nothing fat and well favoured,
but the clergy. The rest of the inhabitants appear meagre, wan,
and melancholy, being mostly employed either in repairing to
mass, or returning from it; sometimes counting their beads, and
at other times perhaps lugging an heavy Saint in their arms. And
therefore, were they not supported under this condition by a certain
natural pride, which is fed partly with the real history of their
former state, and partly with a romantic imagination of their
present grandeur; they would soon become so sensible of their
slavish poverty and superstition, as either to break their own hearts,
or that yoke, which oppresses them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">There</span> are several religious houses in this city, one of Franciscans,
another of Dominicans, a third of Augustins, and a fourth
of Capuchins; besides some nunneries, and a fifth convent called
the <i>Mercy</i>, being founded for the redemption of Christian slaves.
There is likewise an hospital, named the <i>Hospital of St. John of God</i>;
where we saw a large and decent infirmary for sick and wounded
persons, whether natives or foreigners. There is nothing much
remarkable in these places, besides the altar pieces of their chapels,
which are every where gaudily and richly furnished; but those
particularly of the cathedral church, and Dominican convent, are
adorned with tables of wrought and massy silver. On the walls
is seen abundance of painting and imagery, the device of which
is for the most part offensive, or ridiculous. An instance of the
latter was the picture of <i>St. Michael</i>, with a pair of scales in his
hand, weighing the merits of departed saints: of the former, the
pourtraiture of <i>God the Father</i>, in the shape of an <i>old man</i>; with
many other blasphemous representations of the <i>Trinity</i>. Either in
their vestries, or their chapels, there is commonly the <i>Saint</i> of their
order pourtrayed at large, in a gaudy habit, and inclosed in
a case of glass. Other lesser images of Saints they expose in
holes of the wall, where it faces the town; and to these the devouter
part of the people pay their several occasional oraisons, as
they pass the streets. This large multitude of altars and saints,
which every where appears at <i>Cadiz</i>, could not but remind me of
what the priestess in <i>Petronius</i> sais: <i>Utique nostra regio tam praesentibus
plena est numinibus, ut facilius possis deum, quam hominem invenire</i><a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>.
But not to tire your patience with the many odd pieces
of superstition, which occur in every corner of the city, I shall give
you a relish of the whole in the two following instances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> first of these is a specious inscription over the entrance to
a private house, occasion by the following accident. In a late
solemn procession upon <i>Corpus Christi</i> day there happened a storm
of rain, which was in danger of offering some disrespect to the
host; and therefore they thought convenient to give it shelter
in the next house, they could step into. Among these zealous
people this was construed such a blessing to the man and his family,
that the house is ever since looked upon as sacred; and the
owner has been at a considerable charge to erect a pair of marble
pillars at the entrance into his porch, adorned with carving, and
inscribed after this magnificent manner: “That in the year 1692,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
<i>Innocent</i> <span class="allsmcap">XII</span> being Pope, <i>Charles</i> <span class="allsmcap">II</span> King of Spain, <i>Buzzia</i> Bishop
of Cadiz, and <i>Don Velasco</i> governor of the same Herculean
city.” <i>Cum arca vera, panem angelicum carnem factum continens,
triumphali processionis pompa, die festo</i> Dominici Corporis <i>deduceretur,
et, saeviente turbine, irreverentiae periculum immineret; harum
aedium dominus</i>, Didacus de Barias, <i>exivit obviam absconditae
majestati, et fidei Centurionis aemulus procidit, indignum se profitens,
cujus tectum</i> Dominus <i>subiret, eumque honorifice in oratorio suo suscipere
meruit. Quare, Deo favente, sacra catholica majestas cooperari
volens domui huic praeeminentiae praerogativam concessit, etc.</i> This
accident has rendred <i>Didacus de Barias</i> a meer Saint, and his
house a most inviolable sanctuary, in the esteem of the poor Spaniards.
Tho our English merchants well know him to be a rank
Jew, who being therefore liable to death by the law of Spain, was
always forced to live under disguise, and now gladly embraced this
opportunity of passing for a zealot. The Jews indeed have formerly
been very insolent in Spain. One of the last instances of
which was a certain indignity of a shoemaker, who buried a crucifix
under the place, where his customers tried on their shoes, that
by this stratagem he might oblige Christians to stamp upon the
cross. But this nation being since banished that kingdom under
the pain of the severest death, they, who still covertly remain so, are
obliged to profess themselves of the popish faith, which they can do
without any great regret; it being easy to be of two religions,
where both consist only in external show and ceremonies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> other memorable piece of superstition is to be observed in the
convent of the Capuchin friery, who within these three years have
acquired an extraordinary esteem, by means of a certain lady, who
acknowledged herself cured of a dangerous malady by virtue of
their intercession. This was an hint, which they thought very
improvable; and have therefore since set up for such a stock of
merit, that their cloister is already filled with waxen figures of
legs, arms, heads, women’s breasts, and other offerings, of so many
maimed and distempered persons, whom these Saints have restored
by their peculiar interest in heaven. One particularly, who was
indebted to them for a more than ordinary blessing, has erected
a stately monument on that account, before the entrance into
their convent. It is an handsome Ionic pillar, made of white
marble, inrailed with a large square of stone, in the front of which
is a crucifix, and an image of the <i>Virgin</i>, under the title of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
<i>Triumphant Lady</i>. And this new figure is already become such
an idol, that the zealous gossips of the town will often approach
it upon their knees, at near the distance of a furlong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">Having</span> been detained about a week at <i>Cadiz</i>, we set sail October
11, 1699, and by the favour of a fortunate west wind were
advanced within nine days near the entrance of the <i>Faro</i> of <i>Messina</i>;
where we lay becalmed two or three days, under the island of <i>Stromboli</i>,
as after our departure from <i>Messina</i> we did likewise under
mount <i>Aetna</i>. Each of these was an opportunity of entertaining
our sight with the dreadful curiosity of those burning mountains;
where we observed the <i>crater</i> of both to cast up a continued pillar
of smoke, and at repeated distances a terrible red blaze of fire.
Afterwards being favoured with a gentle gale, a pilot came from
the city to steer us thro the difficult strait of <i>Scylla</i> and <i>Charybdis</i>.
Here I was curious to observe the situation of these places, especially
because the latter is used in a confused and uncertain sense
in classic authors. But upon a diligent view of the place it self, and a
companion of some clear expressions in antiquity, the best judgment
I could form of it was this, which follows. In <i>Thucydides</i><a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>, and other
good historians, <i>Charybdis</i> signifies the whole strait betwixt <i>Sicily</i>
and <i>Calabria</i>; but in <i>Homer</i><a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>, <i>Virgil</i><a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>, and other poets, it is restrained
to that peculiar whirlpool, which flows under the opposite
rock of <i>Scylla</i>. Betwixt these two we found the current
so various, that our ship was obliged to stand five or six different
ways in a few minutes sailing; and at the same time it was
surprizing to hear the waves bubble in a continued hideous
noise, well expressed in the poets by the barking of dogs round the
bowels of <i>Scylla</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">As</span> we lay at anchor at <i>Messina</i>, we were presented with a delightful
landskip, which the narrow winding of the <i>Faro</i>, the verdure of
the opposite shores, the wall, the citadel, and town itself afforded.
The front of the whole city is one continued pile of buildings, extending
three quarters of a mile in length, from the Viceroy’s house
to that called the <i>French bastion</i>. It intirely consists of free stone,
being raised four story high, adorned with carved windows, balconies,
battlements, and other ornaments, all answering to each
other with an exact regularity. No house has any doors to the
sea, but the entrance is at large gates, which front so many streets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
of the city, placed at equal distances, and each of them inscribed
with some religious device. This range is contrived, as for ornament,
so likewise for defence; it being at the bottom of a prodigious
thickness, so as to withstand a siege, and decreasing proportionably
towards the top. The whole running in a bend, which is
every where equidistant from the sea, represents a curvilineal amphitheatre.
The inner part of the city does not answer to this magnificence
of the front; tho there often occur many single pieces of
great art and curiosity. Such as the <i>King’s statue</i> on horseback,
exactly resembling that of our late King <i>Charles</i> at <i>Windsor</i>. The
<i>Statue</i> of <i>Don John of Austria</i>, in memory of the victory obtained
by him at <i>Lepanto</i> in 1571. The beautiful structure of a public
<i>fountain</i>, adorned at the bottom with four large and masterly
figures, representing <i>Nilus</i>, <i>Iberus</i>, <i>Tiber</i>, and <i>Euripus</i>. But more
curious than the rest is a figure of <i>Neptune</i> on the mole, cast in solid
brass, and attended on each side with two very natural representations
of the monsters <i>Scylla</i> and <i>Charybdis</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> it was not so entertaining to observe these, as deplorable
to see, what St. <i>Paul</i> bewailed at <i>Athens</i>, a city wholly given to
idolatry and superstition. It affords a melancholy consideration
to any serious spectator, to be witness to so many vain and hypocritical
addresses made to the images and altars, which abound in this
deluded place. For this brings the like scandal upon Christianity,
as was so offensive under the ranked heathenism, and too truly
exposes the subjects of it to that derision of <i>Lucretius</i>:</p>

<p class="noindent">They are here furnished with nunneries and monasteries to the number
of sixty odd, most of which are loftily built, and add the greatest
grace to the structure of the city. In the college of <i>St. Nicholas</i>
I observed the pictures of our five <i>Jesuits</i>, who were executed for the
popish plot, with a specious account when, and how, they were
crowned with martyrdom for the profession of the faith in <i>England</i>.
In the nunnery of <i>Sta. Maria della Scala</i> they shew a stone sculpture
of the <i>Virgin</i> and our <i>Savior</i>, which they verily beleive to
have been taken from the life. In the cathedral church there are
twelve noble figures of the <i>Apostles</i>, exquisitely carved in clear and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
costly marble. The isle, which composes the body of the church, is
ranged on each side with thirteen stately pillars, twelve of which
are antient of the Corinthian order, brought formerly from a
temple of <i>Neptune</i>, that stood near the promontory <i>Pelórus</i>. There
are here three gaudy altars, that want nothing, which art or expence
could contribute to adorn them; for below they are set
with work of <i>lapis lazuli</i>, and above are covered with cupolas of
true mosaic. But over the high altar, at the east end of the cathedral,
is preserved in golden characters, and embellished with a
rich variety of other ornaments, one of the greatest delusions in all
popery. It is a letter, which according to the tradition of this
church was sent to the <i>Messanians</i> by the <i>B. Virgin</i>, upon their
conversion by St. <i>Paul</i>, soon after he touched at <i>Rhegium</i>. It is
reasonably concise, and therefore I shall venture to trouble you
with the words, as faithfully transcribed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">You</span> see, that he, who had the impudence to forge this imposture,
had likewise the stupidity to date it by two <i>epochas</i>, the latter
of which did not commence before the reign of <i>Constantine the Great</i>,
and the former not till that of <i>Justinian</i>. The Hebrew original they
confess not to be now extant. And as to this, which they call the authentic
translation, it would be impossible to beleive them serious
in venting so foul a cheat; but that they pompously expose it to
all the world in their metropolitan church, and celebrate it by a
yearly feast, and public rejoicings of a whole month’s continuance;
that it has been confirmed by repeated indulgences from
the court of <i>Rome</i>; and that at the west end of the church there
are divers solemn inscriptions, importing, that in some general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
calamities of <i>Sicily</i>, there particularly specified, the <i>Virgin</i> still
protected her <i>Messina</i>, according to her most faithful promise in
the <i>Holy Letter</i>. This naturally brings to one’s mind the antient devotion
of the same place towards <i>Ceres</i> and <i>Proserpina</i>, as mentioned
by <i>Cicero</i>, when he says: <i>Vetus est haec opinio, quae constat
ex antiquissimis Graecorum literis et monumentis, insulam Siciliam totam
esse Cereri et Proserpinae consecratam. Hoc cum ceterae
gentes sic arbitrantur; tum ipsis Siculis tam persuasum est, ut animis
eorum insitum et innatum esse videatur</i><a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>. It is to be wondered at,
that these people have not yet registered an accident, of which as to
the fact our English merchants were eye witnesses, namely; that
in the late repeated earthquakes of <i>Sicily</i> in 1693 the tower of this
cathedral, which stands at the west end distinct from the body of
the church, was so distorted by one shock, that it stood very dangerously
in an oblique declining posture; but that about a week afterwards
another shock restored it to its former true perpendicular
situation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap gesperrt">After</span> five days spent in viewing these and other curiosities of
<i>Messina</i>, we set sail the thirtieth of October, and by the ninth of
the next month were obliged by contrary winds to stand into
the port of <i>Milo</i>. This isle, known to the antients by the name
of <i>Melos</i>, and esteemed the largest of all the <i>Cyclades</i>, is deservedly
famous for its fair and commodious harbour; which entring at a
narrow chanel afterwards enlarges itself circularly into a lake, rather
than a bay; being always calm, and spatious enough to receive a
fleet of an hundred and fifty sail. I went ashore at this place with
the greater satisfaction, considering that among other antiquities
it lays claim to <i>Socrates</i> and <i>Aristophanes</i>. It has a city of the
same name, inhabited at present, like the other islands of the
<i>Archipelago</i>, chiefly by Greek Christians, who have been burthened
in the late war by a cruel tax of sixteen thousand dollars to the
Venetians, as well as to the Turks; but by the benefit of the present
peace, as its tribute to the former wholly ceases, so that to the
latter is much mitigated. It is observable, that in every cultivated
feild about the town, there stands a small Greek chapel, constantly
adorned with the painted images of the <i>Virgin</i> and <i>St. George</i>;
and thither the zealous women of the place often retire with a
priest, to say some supererogatory masses for the benefit of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
private relations, whether dead or living. In a cave on the island
there is a natural hot bath, which has proved very successful in
many malignant maladies. Walking on the strand I observed
another of the same nature, like that of <i>Licinius Crassus</i>, mentioned
by Pliny, <i>Lib.</i> xxxi. <i>cap.</i> 2. The heat of this was so great,
that I could not bear to keep my hand in it. The same shore
affords a vein of black sand, of which we there gathered a quantity
very clear and beautiful for the use of writing.</p>

the first elevation of the elements, is what
gives just offence both to the Roman and Reformed
churches; for tho of late they have
generally embraced the doctrine of transubstantiation,
yet by this act they pay a divine
worship to the bread and wine even before this
pretended conversion into the body and
blood of <i>Christ</i>. Not but that this observation
may be well improved to evince the
novelty of this persuasion among the Greeks;
and to shew, that both these ceremonies
were at first but a meer bodily respect to
the elements, and implied nothing of a divine
adoration.</p>

of the <i>Amnis Phrygius</i>, near <i>Magnesia ad

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[21]</a> This <i>Statius Quadratus</i> was that very
proconsul, in whose presence, and by whose
authority, <i>St. Polycarp</i>, bishop of <i>Smyrna</i>,
was burnt alive in the amphitheatre of that
city. His name is falsely written Τάτιος Κ.
in the <i>Alexandrian Chronicle</i>, and Στράτιος in
the <i>Epistle of the church of Smyrna</i>. But this
stone confirms that correction, which has
been made by bishop <i>Pearson</i> and <i>Valesius</i>.
It likewise favours that learned argument
maintained by bishop <i>Pearson</i>, Dissert. ii.
cap. xvi, xvii. pag. 291, by which he places
this proconsulship and the martyrdom of <i>St.
Polycarp</i> in the tenth year of <i>Antoninus
Pius</i>, <i>A. C.</i> 147. For in the fourth year
of <i>M. Antoninus</i>, to which the <i>Alexandrian
Chronicle</i> refers it; as also in the year 167,
to which it is referred by <i>Eusebius</i> and <i>Valesius</i>;
there were two <i>Caesars</i>, concerning
whom <i>Eutropius</i> says: <i>Tunc primum Rom.
respublica duobus aequo jure imperium administrantibus
paruit, cum usque ad eum singulos
semper habuisset Augustos.</i> Lib. viii. cap. 5.
But this inscription mentions only one <i>Caesar</i>,
in the singular number. And as for
that <i>Quadratus</i>, whom <i>Bucherius</i> and <i>Usserius</i>
will have proconsul in <i>Asia</i> in the year
169, his name was not <i>Statius</i>, but <i>T. Numidius</i>.
See also mention of <i>Quadratus</i> in
<i>Aristidis Orat. Genethliac. in Apellam</i>; and
in his <i>Sermon. Sacror.</i> iv.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
